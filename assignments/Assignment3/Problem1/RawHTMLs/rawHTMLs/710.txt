The camp is small and intimate with simplistic elegance, luxury and style, providing an astonishing safari experience. The camp has 12 spacious, insect-proof bedroom tents, each with a private veranda overlooking the river. Inspired by the textures and colors of African nature, each of the 12 beautifully appointed tents surround you with luxury. The en-suite bathrooms are fitted with hot &amp; cold running water, rain showers and flush toilets. Individual verandas encourage guests to linger while admiring the lush wilderness of the area. The cozy lounge and dining area with original oil paintings and soft intimate lighting open to the outside capturing the tranquil surroundings. Dining is a culinary experience with al-fresco meals and candle lit gourmet dinners set either under the African sky or inside the romantic dining area.  <b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>k)Sasaab Camp:</b> Sasaab camp is located on the Ngutuk Ongiron Group Ranch in the West Gate community. The camp can be accessed through an hour&rsquo;s flight from Nairobi into Buffalo Springs (scheduled twice daily) &amp; then an hour drive through Samburu Game Reserve to Sasaab camp with a game drive on the way, or directly into Sasaab&rsquo;s airstrip by private charter. Another alternative would be a six hours drive from Nairobi, across the Equator and past Mount Kenya, into the Northern Frontier District.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<b>l)Saruni Samburu Lodge:</b> Saruni lodge is perched on the top of the Kalama Mountains from which one enjoys an all round view of Northern Kenya  all the way to the snow covered Mount Kenya. It&rsquo;s built on the pristine land owned by the Kalama Wildlife Conservancy in 240,000 acres-large Gir Gir Group Ranch, it is only seven kilometers &#8211; and 20 minutes of exciting game drive &#8211; away from the Northern border of Samburu Game Reserve. The lodge offers first-class safari experience in a totally un-spoilt environment, far from the beaten tracks but very close to the wildlife.</p>

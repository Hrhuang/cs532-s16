   76ers coach Brett Brown's popularity takes a hit after every close
   loss. That's what happens when your team is 8-44 and fans are tired of
   tanking.

   But Doc Rivers, an NBA champion with the Boston Celtics and the current
   coach and president of basketball operations for the Los Angeles
   Clippers, preaches yet more patience for the beleaguered Brown.

   "His teams play hard every night," Rivers said Monday before a 98-92
   overtime victory over the Sixers.

   Rivers, who has coached his own struggling teams over his 17 seasons,
   said it's hard for the Sixers to constantly hear talk "about them being
   traded, about what the team is not doing, about the draft the following
   year."

     [49]Latest Sixers videos For a coach, Rivers said, the job is to
   convince the players to ignore all that and "execute and play hard and
   want to play for your team."

   "He does it," Rivers said of Brown.

   Coaching a young and developing team like the Sixers is challenging for
   many reasons, Rivers said. "Not because they don't know how to play,"
   he said. "Some do."

   But many young players haven't developed the chemistry of a team. They
   haven't learned the value of playing together, the importance of
   playing their roles so the team succeeds as a group.

   "They all want to be the guy," Rivers said.

   The 54-year-old coach uses his coaching days with the Celtics as an
   example. Some of the roughest days were at practices, not games,
   because players were battling one another for court time in the
   upcoming games.

   Then, on game day, the five starters were happy, and the reserves were
   mad at Rivers because they were on the bench. Somehow, Rivers said,
   Brown has kept the Sixers on the same page.

   "I don't understand how he does that," Rivers said.

   The latest criticism of Brown came after Monday's loss to Rivers and
   the Clippers. Twitter was abuzz with complaints about his late-game
   personnel and coaching decisions.

   With the Sixers up by three, why didn't Brown opt to foul center
   DeAndre Jordan, a 41.8 percent free-throw shooter, on the Clippers'
   final possession of regulation?

   And why was 6-foot Ish Smith guarding 6-4 J.J. Redick, who buried the
   game-tying three-pointer with 10.5 seconds left in regulation?

   And why was Nerlens Noel not on the floor for the final play of
   regulation, which ended with Jahlil Okafor's missed jumper at the
   buzzer, and the start of overtime?

   The answers are pretty much the same as they have been all season.
   Brown is still evaluating his young players in certain situations, and
   the front office is still dreaming of draft picks over victories.

   Brown's career record of 45-171 is a direct result of the team's
   several years of tanking.

   So, Rivers said, don't be too quick to judge Brown harshly.

   "I always say all the time, and [Brown] is a great example," Rivers
   said, "I think people make mistakes when they judge you by your record
   sometimes."

   There's a problem brewing in America. It's a certain lack of empathy
   for people, an expectation that no one, especially athletes, is allowed
   to be human and make a mistake. [8]Cam Newton is learning this the hard
   way.

   The [9]Carolina Panthers quarterback was anointed as the chosen one
   through the recently concluded [10]NFL season. Fans and so-called NFL
   experts were saying he was the future of the game, the new face of the
   league. He was named league MVP the day before the [11]Super Bowl.

   Then Newton played a horrible game and his team lost to the [12]Denver
   Broncos, 24-10. With a big smile on his face, Newton congratulated
   [13]Peyton Manning before heading to the locker room.

   Then it all came tumbling down. In the post-game news conference, an
   obviously subdued and depressed Newton didn't answer questions the way
   people thought he should. He gave short, one-word answers to some
   questions. All the while, in the background you could hear a Broncos
   player talking about how they dismantled Newton, knowing he couldn't
   handle the pressure. Newton, hearing all of this, decided to get up and
   leave.

   [17]Cam Newton wasn't himself during his postgame news conference
   Sunday night.

   All season long we've seen the happy, dancing, likable quarterback that
   led the [18]Carolina Panthers to a 15-1 regular-season record and an
   easy romp through the postseason.

   The Internet reacted with outrage. Memes were created mocking Newton.
   How dare he not sit there and answer questions! Take it like a man!
   Steve Young and Deion Sanders [23]criticized him for being immature,
   which is rich coming from Sanders, who [24]once dumped a bucket of
   water, not once, not twice, but three times on Tim McCarver because
   McCarver had dared to criticize him.

   How about looking at it like this: A young man of 26, in the most
   important game of his career, had perhaps his worst performance ever.
   He had to have felt like he let his teammates and his fans down. So he
   reacted like a human being. He was subdued and depressed. That doesn't
   make him a poor sport.

   If he hadn't gone over and congratulated Manning and the Broncos, then
   that would have made him a poor sport. But giving short answers at a
   news conference and walking out because he could hear the Broncos
   criticizing him? That makes him human.

   Ask yourself what you would have done if you had turned in the worst
   performance of your career in your profession, letting your co-workers
   down and ruining a moment you have been working toward your whole life.
   When you were 26. In front of a stadium full of people and over 100
   million watching. And then you had to answer a bunch of questions about
   it.

   In a perfect world, Newton would have sat down and answered everything.
   But it turns out that we don't live in a perfect world. And it turns
   out that Cam Newton is human. Take a look in the mirror because so are
   you. So how about having some empathy, because one day you will need
   some empathy too.

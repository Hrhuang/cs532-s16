Volunteers recreate Alliance Volleyball courts in Ag Center

   After putting out a two-hour notice for help, A-Game's Alliance
   Volleyball had nearly 200 parents and supporters laying down red and
   blue squares atop the covered dirt floor in the Williamson County Ag
   Expo Center on Monday.

   The effort came in partnership with Williamson County Mayor Rogers
   Anderson, who allowed the estranged A-Game tenant to use the facility
   while they remain in limbo over the use of their previous home on 215
   Gothic Court in Franklin.

   "They are bringing the floors up today because of the situation that's
   occurred in the last week," Anderson said. "They asked if they could
   use the facility in conjunction of the tournament this weekend. We
   agreed to work with them so they could have some practice time and
   whatever else they need."

   Parents strung up black nets on posts, while others sat on the ground
   yanking white tape from their rolls to outline the court on the floor.
   Seven of the eight courts were almost finished Monday night after only
   three hours of work. Each of the courts are just more than 110 feet in
   length and under 50 feet in width.

   The courts shipped in from Austin, Texas, five days in advance of the
   President's Day Volleyball Tournament.

   "It usually takes an hour a court," Alliance Volleyball Director Jeff
   Wismer said. "These families got it done in less than three hours. Our
   community rallied. Mayor Anderson gets the credit for this. I am
   stupefied by it. It's amazing."

   The Expo Center will handle seven of the 18 courts needed for the
   weekend's upcoming tournament. The Franklin Field House will help on
   two of the three days of the event. The athletic director of Williamson
   County Parks and Rec also offered some solutions, along with potential
   for Brentwood High School to pitch in some help with the space.

   With a pair of work gloves in his hand, parent Randy Sanders said he
   thought of everyone's effort as a reflection of what their girls could
   learn when life takes an unexpected turn.

   "It is frustrating, certainly," he said. "But with every challenge
   comes an opportunity. So, if life is an easy path or straight line, it
   would be kind of boring. Anytime you get thrown a curve like this, you
   want your kids to develop the ability and reason to say, 'Hey, I am not
   going to let this defeat me. I am going to find a solution and continue
   doing whatever my goal is.'"

   On the flip side, the upcoming hockey tournament this weekend will face
   cancellation, according to a newsletter email sent out by MyHockey
   Tournaments:

   "A-Game Sportsplex has been unable to resolve their legal issues and
   cannot reach an agreement which will allow the rink to open.

   "Our intention has been to re-schedule the tournament based on
   available ice-time at Ford Ice Center. We began sending revised
   schedules to the teams this afternoon but the majority of the teams
   that received the revised schedules have withdrawn from the tournament.
   We no longer have enough teams in any division to hold the tournament.

   "Unfortunately, the entire tournament is cancelled. We are very sorry
   for this situation but it is very much out of our control."

   How the legal and A-Game ownership proposal battle will turn out
   remains undetermined, while its [25]leasing tenants review the
   potential agreement provided to them on Saturday.

   [26]On Friday afternoon, legal representatives for volleyball and
   hockey/figure skating filed an expedited motion for a judge to reverse
   the previous decision and to review their leasing agreements.

   The group had a judge lift a temporary restraining order against itself
   [27]last Tuesday. [28]Two days later, Alliance Volleyball and MDG
   Managment, which handles hockey, had to retrieve their personal
   belongings from A-Game after finding it abruptly locked on Thursday
   morning.

   [29]A-Game users protested for its opening Thursday night in a march
   from the CoolSprings Galleria mall to the complex at 215 Gothic Court,
   waving signs at cars in exchange for honks of support.

   Alliance and MDG have legally enforceable leases which expire in
   September 2017 and December 2019. They asked a judge to expedite that
   motion and hear it no later than tomorrow, Feb. 9.

Elway: No timetable on Manning's decision

   [19]USA Today Sports USA Today Sports 6 days ago by Lindsay H. Jones,
   USA TODAY Sports

   [20]Peyton Manning of the Denver Broncos celebrates with the Vince
   Lombardi Trophy after his team’s Super Bowl 50 victory against the
   Carolina Panthers on Feb. 7, 2016, in Santa Clara, Calif. Super Bowl 50
   ENGLEWOOD, Colo. – Peyton Manning’s boss said Tuesday he won’t rush the
   39-year-old quarterback to make a decision on possibly retiring.

   “There is no deadline. We’ll let Peyton enjoy this,” Broncos general
   manager John Elway said. “Eventually we’ll sit down and talk to him.
   There is no timeline for this.”

   That reinforces the comments Elway made in the days leading up to Super
   Bowl 50, though the team now needs to figure out who will play
   quarterback for the Broncos in 2016. Backup quarterback Brock Osweiler
   is set to become a free agent when the new league year begins on March
   9 and could be a hot commodity on the open market with several teams
   likely looking to add a young quarterback that went 4-2 for a playoff
   team in 2015.

   Still, Elway insists he won’t put any pressure on Manning to tell the
   team of his plans.

   “It’s going to be his decision,” Elway said. “In talking about
   retirement, it’s always hard."

   Elway did not directly answer a question about if the team would want
   Manning to return in 2016 for the final year of his contract should
   Manning decide he wants to keep playing. Elway also was asked about a
   comment Manning’s father, Archie Manning, made Sunday night to NFL
   Network following the Broncos’ 24-10 win in Super Bowl 50 that his son
   was “done in Denver.”

   “I don’t know why Archie would say that,” Elway said. “That’s up to
   Peyton.”

   But Manning and Osweiler are hardly the only roster decisions the
   Broncos face as they know start preparations for 2016. Defensive
   starters Malik Jackson, the defensive end who scored a touchdown in
   Super Bowl 50, and Danny Trevathan, an inside linebacker who recovered
   two fumbles on Sunday, will both be unrestricted free agents. Elway
   said both are priorities and the team will start negotiations with
   those players’ agents soon in an attempt to keep the league’s No.
   1-ranked defense together.

   “That’s the hard thing, but there is no question we’d like to do that,”
   Elway said.

   The Broncos will also begin work on a new long-term deal for Super Bowl
   MVP Von Miller, though the franchise tag remains a possibility in
   absence of a deal by early March.

Record $132.5M Bet on Super Bowl at Nevada Sports Books

   So you thought the Panthers and Broncos would put up a lot more points
   in Super Bowl 50, that Carolina quarterback [100]Cam Newton would score
   at least once and probably be named the game's most valuable player?

   So did a lot of people, and that had Nevada sportsbooks smiling a day
   after they took in a record $132.5 million in wagers on the big game.

   "It was a very good day," Johnny Avello, executive director of the
   sports book at Wynn Las Vegas, said Monday.

   "A defensive battle was something we were rooting for and fortunately,
   that's exactly what it was," added Jay Kornegay, the odds maker at the
   Westgate Las Vegas Superbook.

   A 5.5-point underdog at the casinos, Denver upset Carolina 24-10 — a
   total well below the over-under projection of between 44 and 45. Newton
   was the overwhelming favorite to win this year's MVP, but he failed to
   score and watched Denver linebacker Von Miller take the honor at 12-1
   odds.

   Odds makers said gamblers bet heavily on the Panthers in the weeks
   ahead of the game.

   "But over the last few days, the pendulum swung in Denver's favor and
   really balanced a lot of things out," Kornegay said. "Our best case
   scenario was for the Panthers to win the game, but not cover. So it
   wasn't a best-case, but as long as we stayed under the total, we were
   in good shape."

   The Nevada Gaming Control Board said in its preliminary estimate Monday
   that Nevada's 194 sports books kept about 10.1 percent of the $132.5
   million in Super Bowl wagers, for a total win of $13.3 million.

   The previous record of $119.4 million was set two years ago when
   Seattle beat Denver 43-8. The total win that year was the best recorded
   over the past 10 years, about 16.5 percent or $19.7 million. Wagers
   totaled just under $116 million last year, with a casino win of 2.8
   percent.

   The last time Nevada books lost money on the Super Bowl was 2008 when
   they paid out about $2.6 million more than they took in as the [101]New
   York Giants beat New England, 17-14.

   This year marked the first time Nevada sportsbooks could accept bets on
   the MVP. Traditionally, bets can be made only on things that happen
   during the game. But the Nevada Gaming Commission made the change after
   allowing bets on the Heisman Trophy for the first time last year.

   "We were blown away by the wagering on the MVP," said Michael Grodsky,
   director of marketing at the William Hill Race & Sports Book. "It was a
   very healthy handle on that, and Von Miller winning the MVP was a big
   winner for the public. Ten percent of all the tickets we wrote were on
   Von Miller."

   The odds makers said a low scoring Super Bowl usually translates into
   success for the house when it comes to the so-called prop bets — things
   like will so-and-so score more than so-many touchdowns, or will there
   be a safety, a 2-point conversion, or an overtime?

   The betting public tends to bet "more overs and more yes than no" on
   those questions, Kornegay said.

   "Cam not scoring a touchdown was a very good result for us so was Greg
   Olsen's performance overall," he said about the Panther tight end who
   was held to four catches for 41 yards. "(Carolina receiver) Ted Ginn
   not getting a rushing attempt was another one that went our way."

   Nevada sports books avoided the controversy that plagued some off-shore
   betting sites that had accepted bets on such things as how long it
   would take [102]Lady Gaga to sing the national anthem. The actual
   ending point wasn't clear when she repeated the final word of the
   phrase, "home of the brave."

   "That's exactly why we don't take wagers on that." Kornegay said.
   "There's no official result in a box score."

   The Panthers and the Patriots are the early favorites to win the Super
   Bowl next year. William Hill has Carolina 7-1 and New England 8-1,
   while Pregame.com lists the Patriots 9-1 and the Panthers 10-1.

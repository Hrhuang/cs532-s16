First-year Director of Tennis Lyle McIntosh, Loggers ready for 2016

   Feb 09, 2016

   TACOMA, Washington â€“ The 2016 Puget Sound tennis season opens this
   weekend, and first-year Director of Tennis Lyle McIntosh is ready for
   the new beginning.

   "Our preseason work has been filled with many good days, and we have
   tried to learn diligently from the bad days," said McIntosh. "We look
   forward to beginning our matches this weekend with the conviction of
   creating a team bond focused on what we can give, much more than what
   we can get."

   McIntosh will coach the women's team, while Joe Holland returns as the
   head coach for the Logger men.

   The Puget Sound women's squad is among the youngest in the Northwest
   Conference, as junior Elizabeth Chao is the most experienced Logger.
   Sophomores Farrell Ahlf, Tresa Bild, and Tamara Runnicles look to build
   off a challenging freshman season.

   The women's season begins Saturday, Feb. 13, with a doubleheader at
   College of Idaho, beginning at 9 a.m. The NWC schedule opens at
   Linfield on Feb. 20, and the first home match is Feb. 27 against
   Pacfic.

   Lone senior [82]Daniel Deuel leads the returners for the Logger men's
   team. Similarly to the women's team, the men will rely heavily on a
   solid group of sophomores: [83]Jacob Kompolt, [84]Joe McRoberts,
   [85]Chet Selis, and [86]Andrew Struzenberg.

   Puget Sound opens it slate at home against Linfield on Feb. 20, at 1
   p.m.

   McIntosh aims not only to improve the tennis programs in terms of wins,
   but also in culture. "We are competing in the classroom, giving
   everything in our daily training, competing for each other come match
   time, and appreciative of the opportunity to represent the University
   of Puget Sound on and off the court."

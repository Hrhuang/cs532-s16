   A place for sharing links to good-looking cabling (primarily data
   centers) that could be considered art (or porn) to the network junkies
   of Reddit.

   Submission Guidelines:
    1. IF IT LOOKS LIKE SPAGHETTI, WE DON'T WANT TO SEE IT.
    2. SEE RULE #1
    3. Please don't post non-cableporn stuff, memes, or other low-effort
       content.
    4. Image posts only, text posts can be directed to
       [122]/r/cableadvice.
    5. Small DIY projects are usually better suited for
       [123]/r/cablemanagement or [124]/r/homelab unless your cabling is
       truly exceptional.

   While you are welcome to post photos of setups you didn't create, if
   the photos are of your own work, it's worth including a quick write up
   of what's going on for those curious.

   Smaller projects are okay as long as they're exceptionally clean and
   interesting, and you include some explanation.

   Please note we do not accept NSFW material. This is a subreddit that
   people view and post to from work, therefore we'd like to keep any
   non-work-safe material out.

   This subreddit is still in its [DEL: infancy :DEL] toddlerhood but
   growing constantly. If you want to see something here that isn't, get
   in touch with [125]iDemonix or the other mods.

   Related Subreddits:
     * [126]/r/cableadvice: Advice on cabling-related projects,
       techniques, or products.
     * [127]/r/homelab: If you want to show off something cool you built,
       but it's not quite sexy enough for this sub, try here.
     * [128]/r/cablemanagement: If it's a picture of the inside of a PC,
       it probably belongs here.
     * [129]/r/cablefail: In case this sub is too tidy for you.

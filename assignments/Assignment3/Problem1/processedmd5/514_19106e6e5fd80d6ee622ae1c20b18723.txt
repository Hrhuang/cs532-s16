   Someone on the Internet once told us that making stick figure comics is
   easy as hell, and that we were ugly and stupid.

   They were right on all counts. So, after crying for a few hours, we
   created the [55]Random Comic Generator ([56]and free iPhone app!),
   which since its inception in 2014 has entertained millions with its
   computer-generated comedy.
   Go play with the RCG if you haven't already. It has around 20 million
   combinations. We'll wait! Go play with the RCG if you haven't already.
   It has around 20 million combinations. We'll wait!

   After a few weeks of playing with the Random Comic Generator, we
   started to wonder if its hundreds of random panels might lend
   themselves to a card game, where you compete against your friends to
   finish a comic with a funny punchline. So we printed out all of the RCG
   panels and started playing with them.

   Well, it worked. It worked really, really well (with a few tweaks).

   And now we think our game, Joking Hazard, is ready to bring to the
   world. With your help, of course.

   The game itself includes a deck of 250 unique panel cards (we did the
   math, and that’s 15.4 million combinations of comics) most of which are
   so messed up we can’t show them on Kickstarter without censoring them.
   And we’re against censorship, so instead we’ll censor the word “deck”
   itself.

   For $25 you will get a single d*ck. Brand new and wrapped in plastic.

   For $35, we'll also add in a 50 card booster pack, called "Blast From
   The Past", for your d*ck. It includes all your favorite jokes,
   especially ones about World War 2.

   Feel like pledging $60? Congrats, you are now the proud owner of two
   d*cks and two copies of the Blast From The Past booster pack! Hoard
   them for yourself, or share a d*ck with a friend. That’s Christmas
   taken care of!

   Want to spend more than $60? Check out the list of reward tiers to the
   right. We’ll do all kinds of things with your d*ck. Not only that, but
   if the community helps us unlock the achievements below, everyone's
   d*ck will become bigger.

Risks and challenges

   On our first Kickstarter (The Cyanide & Happiness Show Season 1) the
   biggest issue we had was over-merchandising the rewards, which created
   a lot of headache and delays in getting the items physically produced.
   Making thousands of t-shirts is a nightmare we would not wish upon our
   worst enemy. So this time we're keeping it simple, and giving people
   exactly what they're supporting: the game itself.

   *Note: Extra shipping charges may apply to certain countries.

FAQ

     * [58]Why is shipping so high for my country?
       To avoid under-budgeting on shipping and sending our Kickstarter
       into a flaming death spiral, we went into agonizing detail to
       calculate international shipping costs to the exact dollar,
       including non-obvious things like import taxes, which we're paying
       for you. In lot of countries (and for the EU especially), you'll
       often pay one shipping charge and then get hit with an unexpected
       second fee by your local post office, because the item came from
       abroad. That's not the case here. We're covering those fees for you
       so the game can just arrive at your doorstep.

     * [59]This game seems similar to Cards Against Humanity. Are you guys
       inspired by them and/or talentless hacks?
       It's similar in the sense that you get to anonymously judge your
       friends, but the differences become very, very apparent as you
       start to play Joking Hazard. It's group storytelling. You're
       creating a weird (and often horribly wrong) three-panel scenario
       starring two characters, and often times the winning punchline wins
       for very unexpected reasons. You're just as likely to create a very
       real, tragic comic as you are a funny one, which can be even
       funnier.
       For the record we're big fans of Cards Against Humanity.

     * [60]Does shipping include VAT, handling, etc?
       Yep. The shipping price is all inclusive. We didn't want any
       surprise costs to show up for you with your package.
       Last updated: Wed, Feb 10 2016 7:30 pm EST
     * [61]I pledged money, but then you announced "stretch goals" with
       more cards. Can I get those?
       Yes! If we unlock a stretch goal, it will automatically be applied
       to your reward (unless otherwise noted). At the top of the campaign
       page you can see an up to date graphic of the main reward tiers,
       and what they currently include.
       If you're a backer and want to help us hit our stretch goals
       faster, you can participate in our community achievements (see the
       campaign page) or just spread the word about our game. Every bit
       helps!
       Last updated: Wed, Feb 10 2016 10:59 pm EST
     * [62]Any chance you guys will make some of the other rewards for
       more then just one backer?
       We want the super limited tiers to be something special, so we're
       keeping them at one backer. If we gave our "special gift" away all
       willy-nilly, it wouldn't be so special anymore!
       Keep an eye on the page, we'll be adding more throughout the
       campaign as surprises.
       Last updated: Thu, Feb 11 2016 4:27 pm EST
     * [63]I noticed on one of the panels that you censored out "dick". Is
       the game going to be censored like that? This would really concern
       me, and I feel that censoring the game's swear words would make it
       much much less fun.
       No way! We censored art on the site because The Man said having
       uncensored art would prevent us from getting the word out for the
       project. Rest assured, you'll see EVERYTHING on the actual cards.
       Last updated: Thu, Feb 11 2016 4:27 pm EST
     * [64]Will Joking Hazard be available for purchase on your website
       after the campaign?
       Once we get all the games produced after the Kickstarter ends, yep.
       You'll be missing out on the KS exclusive cards though.
       Last updated: Thu, Feb 11 2016 9:27 pm EST
     * [65]Who's printing the game?
       The game is being manufactured by AdMagic, the same people who
       produce Cards Against Humanity and Exploding Kittens. They've been
       amazing to work with so far!
       Last updated: Thu, Feb 11 2016 9:29 pm EST
     * [66]Why do the cards in your video look different than the ones in
       the campaign images?
       What you see in the video is one of our prototype decks, which we
       have printed locally by a family-owned print shop. These cards
       don't have fancy gloss or any artwork on the back, but they work
       perfectly for us testing and improving the game.
       The final cards will be high quality and professionally produced by
       AdMagic, the same company who prints Exploding Kittens and many
       other card games.

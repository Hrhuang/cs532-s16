   [39]New Sports Minister Nii Lante Vanderpuije shocked at FA’s decision
   to depend on Government

   By Frank Darkwah

   New Sports Minister Hon. Nii Lante Vanderpuije is astounded by the
   Ghana Football Association’s failure to fend for the Black Stars team.


   The former GBC Sports presenter who was appointed to replace Dr.
   Mustapha Ahmed has described the Ghana Football Association’s actions
   to depend hugely on the national budget as an irony.

   The Black Stars over the years have received the highest number of
   shares in the budgetary allocations to the various National teams
   despite its numerous sponsors.

   The team is currently the most sponsored National team in the country
   with over five sponsorship deals with Puma, Unibank, GNPC, Rice Master,
   Cheki Ghana etc.

   These various deals from investigation than by Ghanasportsonline.com
   come with monetary incentive.

   Nii Lante speaking at his vetting session before the Parliamentary
   Appointment Committee on Monday expressed shock at the Ghana Football
   Association’s decision to depend on Government.

   “It is an irony for me that people who are able to attract the
   necessary sponsorship and funding still will take a major chunk of the
   budget that is meant for the whole ministry and the other sports
   disciplines,” he said.

   “I think that we should be able to look at the possibility of making
   the GFA self-sufficient so that we can wean them off the budget so that
   we can have the little that we can have for the other disciplines which
   are equally important to us.

   “Possibly they are the only sporting association that has that huge
   amount of support, sponsorship and the rest.

   “Together with them, we should be able to look for more sponsors to add
   up to what they are getting so that wean them off the ministry’s
   allocation.”

   The former Sports Jounlaist is expected to be in office for the next
   nine months.

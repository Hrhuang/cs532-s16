   Jay Busbee's "Earnhardt Nation: The Full-Throttle Saga of NASCAR's
   First Family" hit shelves Feb. 16.

Jay Busbee's "Earnhardt Nation: The Full-Throttle Saga of NASCAR's First
Family" hit shelves Feb. 16.

   Dale Earnhardt drove NASCAR from its Southern good ol’ boy roots into a
   national obsession at 200 mph and a tankful of menace. He lived and
   died a legend.

   His son, Dale Earnhardt Jr., took possession of that legend but his
   most notable contribution to the sport may ultimately lie in winning
   the Most Popular Driver award 13 seasons in a row. Even that isn’t a
   record.

   Throw in a grieving widow turned recluse grasping for control of her
   husband’s profitable legacy and a daughter who could have been a
   contender and it’s a helluva of a story.

   And the one told by Jay Busbee, a writer for Yahoo Sports, in
   “Earnhardt Nation: The Full-Throttle Saga of NASCAR’s First Family.”
   The new book arrives just days before the flag waves at the 58th
   Daytona 500, the season opener and the sport’s Super Bowl.

   Dale Sr. followed his father Ralph into racing. Ralph was a brilliant
   short-track racer.

   While it took Dale Sr. some time to become established on the track, he
   did win first pole at fatherhood. Earnhardt had his son, Kerry, at 17
   before another failed marriage produced Kelley and Dale Jr.

Earnhardt had no problem imposing his will on other drivers, often bullying
his way to wins with his aggressive driving that fans loved.

   By the time his impoverished ex-wife, Brenda, sent Kelly and Dale Jr.,
   to live with him, Earnhardt was on his third marriage to Teresa, the
   daughter of a racing family, who it turned out had a real flair for
   what would come to be known as branding.

   Together, the two of them, Busbee writes, would one day change the face
   of NASCAR.

   Dale Earnhardt's first win came in 1979, but it wasn't until nearly a
   decade later until he took over the sport. Jamie Squire/Getty Images

Dale Earnhardt's first win came in 1979, but it wasn't until nearly a decade
later until he took over the sport.

   It wasn’t until 1987 that Earnhardt dominated the sport, though. Till
   then, he’d won some championships, but that year he went
   full-Earnhardt. If a car could snarl, his would as he bullied his way
   through creating openings where there were none.

   “If the difference between victory and failure meant knocking the
   living crap out the next guy, so be it,” writes Busbee.

   His inner “bastard” came out, roaring at full speed.

   But Earnhardt wasn’t just a thug on wheels. His driving skills were
   formidable. They said he could read the air as his Chevy flew through
   spaces it couldn’t possibly fit.

   Those skills and that aggression were both on display at the 1987
   All-Star race. Earnhardt was in the lead when Bill Elliot pulled up and
   with a tap sent Earnhardt sideways, shooting through the grassy
   infield.

   Earnhardt should have at least spun out. Instead he created one of the
   most legendary moments in race history.

   He never took his foot off the gas, keeping pace with Elliot until he
   was able to wrench his car back on the track, still in the lead. Fans
   simply couldn’t believe what they saw. The maneuver went down as “The
   Pass in the Grass,” though technically it wasn’t that.

   Things only got worse for Elliot. Earnhardt maneuvered the other driver
   into a position from where he could run Elliot’s car high on the wall
   on the turn. Earnhardt won.

   Elliot, whose sweet temper was almost his trademark, stormed into the
   press room, “I’m sick and tired of it ... If a man has to run over you
   to beat you, it’s time for this stuff to stop.”

   Earnhardt merely shrugged and drawled, “Not everyone can be the good
   guy.”

Dale Earnhardt celebrates after winning the Daytona 500 in 1998, the first
time he had ever won NASCAR's most famous race.

   To short-list Earnhardt’s lifetime achievements it need only be said he
   won seven championships. But the Man in Black’s daring feats drew such
   worship through the years that the buzz pulled in new, even Northern,
   fans just as NASCAR was positioning itself to go national.

   The newly anointed but still rough-hewn celebrity didn’t always play
   along. While Earnhardt was right proud of his screen moment in Burt
   Reynolds’ “Stroker Ace,” when a Hollywood crew entered two cars in an
   official race to film footage for Tom Cruise’s “Days of Thunder,”
   Earnhardt threatened to wreck them.

   He would have done it too. Being surly was his thing. While he was
   immensely charitable in private, particularly moved by the plight of a
   child in need, everywhere else he was an intimidating presence.

   It was an essential ingredient in the Earnhardt persona that Teresa
   brilliantly marketed down to every last #3 keychain and Man in Black
   beer cooler. Between her sales and his winnings, their fortune swelled
   to $40 million.

   Life was sweet. His workspace on the Mooresville, N.C. estate was so
   big and so well-appointed that it was dubbed the “garage-mahal.”
   Earnhardt owned a Lear jet, a helicopter and a 76-foot Hatteras.

   The money didn’t seem to trickle down to his kids, though he did use
   his helicopter once to swoop low over the pool, rousting Junior’s
   hard-partying buddies. In early interviews, Junior talked about how
   much beer he could put away. It was a lot.

   When Junior started racing, the boy was so underfunded some nights he
   slept in his car.

   Dale Sr. wouldn't back Dale Jr.'s racing dreams financially until he
   saw that the kid had what it took to race for DEI.

   Dale Sr. saw his daughter Kelley Earnhardt as being the one with real
   talent, and wooed her home from college to race, hiring Junior to help
   build a car for his sister.

   But in the mid-90s, the NASCAR culture had no use for a woman driver,
   even one with the last name Earnhardt. At one point she couldn’t even
   hire a pit crew. Kelley called it quits and went over to the business
   side, ironically playing a major role in bringing Danica Patrick to
   NASCAR in 2010.

   Earnhardt didn’t fully throw himself behind his son until Junior showed
   he had at least some of the right stuff racing for Dale Earnhardt Inc.
   One of Senior's first steps was to set up a licensing deal for his boy.
   It didn’t take long for Dale Earnhardt Jr. to become one of the most
   successful brands in sports history.

   But the reconciled father and son didn’t have many years together.

   The legend’s career was definitely in a backslide when in 1998, after
   19 fails, Earnhardt finally won NASCAR’s biggest race, the Daytona 500.
   Pulling the black #3 onto pit road he was met by every crew member from
   every team lined up to shake his hand.

   In 2001, the Daytona 500 had very different outcome.

Earnhardt, the seven-time Winston Cup champion, died from injuries sustained
in the crash on the last lap of the 2001 Daytona 500.

   As the race reached its final moments, Earnhardt was third behind his
   son and DEI driver Michael Waltrip. In the celebratory melee that
   greeted Waltrip’s victory, people started asking why the boss wasn’t
   there.

   The accident that killed Earnhardt less than half a mile from the
   finish line hadn’t seemed that bad. Kenny Schrader piled into
   Earnhardt’s right side, sending him into the wall at 147 mph. There
   were many injuries, but it was a basilar skull fracture that killed
   him.

   NASCAR had lost its greatest driver at its greatest race.

   Kingdom, United States, Germany (Austria, Switzerland via Germany) and

A memorial was started by fans paying tribute to the NASCAR legend, who was
killed in February 2001 during a final lap crash of the Daytona 500.

   Junior considered quitting. Yet he was strapped in for the first race
   after his father’s funeral at Rockingham. On the first lap, an accident
   forced Junior into the wall and crushed his car. NASCAR nation had a
   very bad moment until Junior crawled out unscathed.

   Junior’s life in the fast lane accelerated, just not on the track. MTV
   “Cribs” filmed at his home in his purple lit “Club E,” where he could
   cram in as many as 250 party-goers.

   but his stepmother refused to let him take the #8 with him, so he
   switched to 88. Jonathan Ferrey/Getty Images

Dale Earnhardt Jr. left DEI — the team his father founded — in 2007, but his
stepmother refused to let him take the #8 with him, so he switched to 88.

   He made People’s 50 Most Beautiful list and showed up in a Jay Z music
   video, among others. He celebrated his 30th birthday with a legendary
   throwdown that included Ludacris and Third Eye Blind. Junior showed up
   at his next race with a black eye.

   Still he was racing and racing a lot. Following an accident in 2004, he
   won four races immediately afterward — but in the next eight years he
   rode to victory only three times.

   Meanwhile, Teresa’s control over DEI was total. She even owned the
   rights to Junior’s name. He managed to wrest that much back before
   things with his hauntingly reclusive and seemingly hostile stepmother
   came to a head.

   Increasingly, people were referring to Teresa as an absentee owner who,
   as one observer put it, didn’t realize that while “she owned the team
   her stepson owned the sport.”

   Junior split with DEI in 2007. His stepmother wouldn’t let him take #8
   with him, so he switched up to 88.

   During his long losing streak, Junior would retreat from sniping fans
   to his gated spread north of Mooresville.

   Junior has found some success recently — including his win at the 2014
   Daytona 500 — but will never be able to live up to his father's legacy.

Junior has found some success recently — including his win at the 2014
Daytona 500 — but will never be able to live up to his father's legacy.

   One of the pleasure centers he installed at “Dirty Mo’ Acres” was a
   complete facsimile of an Old West town.The sheriff’s department had
   working jail cells and Silverado Saloon was fully functional.

   Junior went on to better years and his share of high-profile wins,
   though his record doesn’t approach his father’s. Now in his 40s,
   emerging from his playboy years, he recently became engaged to interior
   designer Amy Reimman.

   Kelley Earnhardt is a prominent business figure in NASCAR. Their much
   younger stepsister, Taylor Earnhardt Putnam, is a rodeo rider.

   Teresa hasn’t been made a public appearance since Dale Earnhardt’s
   induction to the hall of fame in 2010. Devoted NASCAR fans resent how
   little she’s done with his legacy in the fifteen years since his death.

   But even though his museum seems a barely attended shell these days,
   Busbee makes one thing abundantly clear.

   Dale Earnhardt’s legend has never faded.

            [189][DEL: @ :DEL] alex_prewitt I remember the Caps changing
            goalies twice in a game. I think it was Pete Peeters; he said,
            "I simply HAD TO GO."

            alex_prewitt You overlooked that his last name is "Peeters."
            But with my last name, I don't make fun of people's names!

            alex_prewitt I was referring to your spelling his last name
            "Peters" instead of "Peeters." It makes the pun for you....

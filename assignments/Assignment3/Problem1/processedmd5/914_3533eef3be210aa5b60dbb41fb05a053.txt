   First off, a quick introduction. If you don't know what [50]FanDuel is,
   well, you're missing out. FanDuel is a site that offers daily fantasy
   sports games. Participants get a chance every day to select new
   players, fill out a lineup and, most importantly, win some cash. If you
   choose poorly Monday, you can come back Tuesday and try again. Easy as
   that. [51]Click here to enter a free league for news users today.

   As for what we're doing in this space: The goal here will be to direct
   your attention toward some players who you might not otherwise
   consider. If you're here and reading this, then you already know
   that [52]LeBron James is really good. But when filling out a roster you
   can't just pick out stars. You'll blow your cap and get stuck praying
   to the basketball gods that a guy like [53]Kosta Koufos gets into the
   game. No, if you want to win, you have to take advantage of certain
   matchups -- and in order to do that you have to know where to look.
   That's what we're here for. Also, this space is going to be used to
   give you advice for the games on Tuesday, Feb. 9. So, with that, let's
   get started.

3 players to target

   [54]Stephen Curry, PG, [55]Warriors ($10,900): He's going for boatload
   of cash, but you probably need to have Curry in your lineup if you want
   to win anything on Tuesday. The reason: Golden State is facing the
   hapless defense of the [56]Rockets, a team allowing opposing point
   guards to score nearly 46 FanDuel points per night over their last 10
   games (via [57]RotoWire). That the Rockets play a fast pace will only
   give Curry more chances to light up the scoreboard. Look for him to put
   up a big night.

   [58]Carmelo Anthony, SF, [59]Knicks ($8,900): No team is allowing more
   FanDuel points per night to small forwards than the [60]Wizards, who
   face Anthony and the Knicks on Tuesday. Carmelo should also be able to
   push himself a bit more than he has over the past couple of weeks with
   this being the Knicks' final game before the All-Star break.

   [61]Trevor Ariza, SF, Rockets ($5,800): Ariza has been inserted into
   Houston's starting lineup and seen more than 30 minutes of playing time
   in each of the Rockets' last five games. If he gets 30 minutes again
   Tuesday against the Warriors, he should be able to fill up the box
   score given the fast pace that Houston and Golden State both play.

3 players to avoid

   [62]Dwyane Wade, SG, [63]Heat ($7,400): Wade draws the short straw on
   Tuesday in that he'll have to go up against human blanket Kawhi
   Leonard. As if that wasn't enough to deter you from putting him in your
   lineup, you should know also that the Heat and the [64]Spurs are two of
   the slowest-playing teams in the league. Wade's opportunities will be
   limited on Tuesday, and when he does have the ball he'll be facing the
   NBA's best defense. None of that projects favorably.

   [65]LaMarcus Aldridge, PF, Spurs ($7,300): That said, the Heat are no
   slouches on defense, either. Between Chris Bosh and Hassan Whiteside,
   Miami has two of the league's premier interior defenders, while Bosh
   has the foot speed and athleticism to stay with Aldridge out on the
   perimeter. Aldridge seems to finally be getting comfortable in the
   Spurs' system. But Miami's D is one of the league's best.

   [66]Chandler Parsons, SF, [67]Mavericks ($6,700): Parsons has been
   playing great of late, but he has a tough matchup Tuesday against the
   [68]Jazz. Utah is surrendering just 30 FanDuel points per night to
   opposing small forwards and has been one of the league's top defensive
   teams since [69]Rudy Gobert returned to the lineup.

   Other Notables

   It's quickly mentioned above, but Tuesday's Heat-Spurs game should be
   completely avoided. ... On the other end of the spectrum are the
   Warriors and Rockets, the teams to look at Tuesday if you're looking
   for favorable matchups based on pace. [70]Draymond Green in particular
   could have a huge night. ... The Knicks struggle when it comes to
   containing point guards, which could mean [71]John Wall is in for a big
   night.

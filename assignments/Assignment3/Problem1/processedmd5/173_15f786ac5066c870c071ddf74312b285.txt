Beck Taxi urging drivers not to take part in strikes during NBA All-Star Game

   Toronto’s biggest taxi brokerage is urging its drivers not to take part
   in blockades or strikes aimed at this weekend’s NBA All-Star Game,
   saying disrupting the event would “give Uber exactly what they want.”

   The president of Beck Taxi will be sending repeated pleas to drivers
   through the week, trying to persuade them not to join the brewing
   protests.

   “Some may want to convince you a protest that upsets this big event
   would help us get our message out,” read a note to drivers on Tuesday
   from Gail Beck-Souter. “They are wrong. It would only hurt our valued
   customers.”

   The NBA All-Star Game is expected to generate about $100-million for
   the local economy and bring international attention. But the prospect
   of taxi disruptions are hanging over it, as unhappy cabbies consider
   leveraging the weekend’s sporting events to bring attention to their
   cause.

   Many in the industry are furious at the way Uber is undermining their
   livelihood. A particular source of ire is the UberX model of matching
   passengers with non-professional drivers using private vehicles. UberX
   is not currently covered under the city’s bylaws, which are being
   updated to take in both this sort of company and the traditional taxi
   industry. Tempers have frayed in the meantime, and many blame Mayor
   John Tory personally for their plight.

   Paul Sekhon, head of the United Taxi Workers Association of the GTA,
   predicted on Monday that protests this weekend would be similar to the
   cabbie blockade that closed Queen Street for hours in December, only
   bigger and in multiple locations around the core.

   He said there were only two ways to stop it from happening. “Shut down
   UberX, ASAP,” the driver, plate-owner and manager at City Taxi said.
   “Or Mayor Tory can step down.”

   But another industry leader, Sajid Mughal, president of the
   iTaxiWorkers Association, said the final decision on a protest would
   not be made until Thursday. He said drivers understand the concerns
   about alienating the public, but he argued that they are in dire
   straits.

   “We, as a cab industry, have been alienated by everyone, mostly [the]
   mayor,” Mr. Mughal said. “We are suffering financially … our tummies
   are empty.”

   In her statement to drivers, Ms. Beck-Souter acknowledged the
   frustration that many feel and pledged to fight for a fair deal.

   “I get you feel left behind, forgotten, dispensable, that no one values
   the dedication you’ve made to this industry and the people of Toronto,”
   she wrote.

   “But I want you to know that I value your contribution and I’m going to
   keep fighting for you. I’m going to write you every day this week to
   ask that you avoid this protest. It will not help our industry. I know
   in my heart of hearts there is a better way to accomplish our goals. I
   trust the people of Toronto believe in fairness and equity, and that
   city hall will come to reflect in their decisions the values of
   Torontonians.”

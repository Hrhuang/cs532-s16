[17]Thank You, Gametrailers

   Last night I found out about GameTrailers closing its doors and I felt
   it. It was a weird thing for me, to feel this sadness about a website
   closing its doors to the public but I have been visiting GT since a
   little after I graduated high school in 2002. As many have said in
   other GT pieces, there was no YouTube at the time yet and finding GT
   was one of the best things in my gaming life. I watched all the
   Retrospects, some my most beloved gaming series like Castlevania and
   Metroid were covered. I had finally found a place that cared about
   games, a place that understood that games and the world around them is
   the most compelling part about them.

   There were so many things that GT provided me with before anyone else
   did and of those things my favorite became the crew. I don’t have any
   elaborate stories of how I hung out or how I was there for all the cool
   streams but I have endearing memories with almost all of them.

   The most recent was a little before Star Wars Battlefront came out, I
   forget what conference was happening but it was terribly boring. I was
   watching it with part of the GT crew including Elyse Willems. Everyone
   on the GT panel was bored and so was I.  I had hopped on Twitter on my
   phone, had a little exchange wit Elyse and saw that there was a
   gameplay video for Battlefront that had just recently been posted. I
   tweeted it to Ellise and she brought it up to the panel! That’s was
   such a cool moment, I was watching GT stream and Elyse was looking down
   at her phone and at some point read my tweet. The panel rejected the
   motion to watch the video instead of the press conference because it
   would be shown later anyway. I tweeted at Elyse again something along
   the lines of “it’s okay, we tried. :)” I hit send and a few moments
   later, she looks at her phone and you see a smirk. It could’ve been
   something else but I like to think it was my tweet.

   Huber, the jolliest person probably ever, was the first of the crew to
   follow me back on Twitter! Huber Hype was a favorite of mine, a
   celebration of gaming for the sake of fun. There was no talk of scores
   or harsh criticism, even when Resident Evil 6 was the topic, it was
   never  ridiculed. All games are good for someone. Huber Hype is real
   and I shared that Hype with Huber when Shenmue 3 was announced. Felt
   good to know I wasn’t the only one with such an enthusiastic reaction
   to the announcement. Thanks for that, Huber!

   So many memories with a group of people that I’ve never met in person
   but with whom I  nonetheless made a connection with. I would watch
   ManUp and GT Time and make comments about the set to Ian or little
   editing “Easter eggs” I would find and mention to him and he would
   reply or like my message. Ben Moore with the love for JRPGs and RPGs in
   general, always brought a sincere outlook on whatever the game too was.
   Bosman, a fellow Nintendo fan with a more realistic view of the
   developer he likes. I appreciate that, I’ve always said I’m a Nintendo
   loyalist, not a fan boy. I feel like that’s what Bosman is too, loyal
   to Nintendo and a fan but never afraid to admit and point out its short
   comings.

   Everyone in GT became my friend, I saw them 3-4 times a week! I don’t
   see some of my local friends that often. Now I won’t see them either.
   However, before I met all of them through their shows and on Twitter, I
   became acquainted with a faceless voice. Brandon Jones.

   At the time I found GT I didn’t even know who Brandon was, for a while
   I thought that maybe Geoff Keighley might be the voice of GT. I wasn’t
   sure though. One time, GT tried using other people to VO the trailers
   for the first time and none of us liked it. I would be very vocal about
   my dislike in the comments, I didn’t want another voice coming into GT!
   This is about the time I learned who the voice was, I learned about
   Brandon Jones and who he was to GT. Now that GT has closed, it has
   dawned on me how much it also meant to me. For all you did, for giving
   me a place to call home on the net and for giving me a group of
   friends… Thank You, Brandon Jones. GT was more than just a website, you
   were part of my daily life and thus part of my family.

   Best of luck to all at GT, I hope you make something else because the
   Internet feels a lot lonelier today.

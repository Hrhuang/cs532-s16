   Booz Allen does not just have a data science team. Yes, we are proud of
   our industry leading, 600+ member group of data scientists; but that
   team is not evidence of our firm simply checking a box in the
   technology market. Our data science capabilities, in contrast, are
   indicative of our diagnostic fascination with finding new, better ways
   of answering our world’s oldest questions.

   To celebrate data science as a discipline against the backdrop of our
   Data Science Bowl, we have pulled together a selection of a few of our
   favorite problems solved by analytics. Here’s to growing this list in
   2016 and beyond:

   Predicting pass or run in the NFL

   Last spring, we unveiled our [50]BlitzD application for the Microsoft
   Surface Pro 3, capable of predicting the next play of an NFL game in
   real-time. The platform awed audiences at the MIT Sloan Sports
   Analytics Conference, and we hope to one day bring this technology to a
   sideline near you.

   From the boardroom to the batter’s box

   Also from our Sports Analytics team, [52]this model is capable of
   predicting the next pitch in an MLB game with an average of 74.5
   percent accuracy. The initial framework encompassed 400 pitchers and
   officially launched our work in the sports world.

   Wait, where should I park?

   We analyzed open, public data from the San Francisco Police
   Department’s CABLE system and were able to pinpoint when and where it
   is most likely for your car to be stolen in the city; an incredible use
   case of data science’s direct ability to fight crime.

   [53]digital disease

   Digital Disease Detection

   Our Epidemico team’s [54]HealthMap platform uses public data to provide
   real-time, population health tracking around the world. This technology
   has become a trusted asset for global healthcare experts, international
   travelers and everyone looking to stay healthier, all year long.

   Book your flights yesterday

   Our analytics team works deeply within the airline industry and, last
   year, [55]discovered that booking behavior has shifted by one week,
   resulting in earlier consumer competition for seats.

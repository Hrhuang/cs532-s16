Bull for Bull: Pau Gasol to replace Jimmy Butler in All-Star Game

   [96]Jimmy Butler is [97]out of the NBA All-Star Game in Toronto this
   weekend due to a strained knee. Which sucks, because he earned that
   spot, and while the fans didn’t vote him in the coach’s did.

   Butler’s teammate [98]Pau Gasol will replace him.

   NBA Commissioner Adam Silver gets to make the call on a replacement,
   and he stayed in Chicago, but he added a front court player to replace
   a guard. Keeping a Bulls representative might have been part of the
   thinking. The coaches’ votes on replacement players has been weighed in
   the past (Gasol may have been high on that list, coaches love him).
   Also, the East roster has a lot of wings and was light on bigs
   ([99]Andre Drummond, [100]Paul Millsap and [101]Chris Bosh are the only
   real bigs), so this gives coach Tyronn Lue some flexibility up front.

   The East leading Cleveland Cavaliers remain with just one
   representative, [102]LeBron James (voted in by the fans).

   Gasol is averaging 17 points, 10.9 rebounds, and a couple blocks a
   game, and is the only thing close to a consistent performer the Bulls
   have. Besides the injured Butler.

   Former Hawks forward [121]Ivan Johnson was [122]banned from the Korea
   Basketball League in 2010.

   Now, Johnson – who has also been [123]ejected from the NBA summer
   league and [124]suspended from the D-League – has gotten banned in the
   Philippines.

   [125]Philippine Basketball Association:

     For addressing the Commissioner with profanities and showing utter
     disrespect for authority, Tropang TNT import Ivan Johnson has been
     banned from the PBA and fined P250,000.

   Betting is now open for which country will bounce Johnson next.

Report: Chris Bosh facing ‘potentially serious health situation’

   [137]Chris Bosh somewhat mysteriously pulled out of the All-Star game
   and 3-point contest Friday – pretty late notice – with what was
   described as a strained calf.

   But there was concern Bosh – who was shut down last season around this
   time with [138]blood clots on his lung – had a [139]related clotting
   issue in his leg.

   [140]Barry Jackson of the Miami Herald:

     The Heat was concerned on Monday about another potentially serious
     health situation involving Chris Bosh, multiple sources said.

     Bosh missed Sunday’s All-Star game with a strained calf and returned
     to Miami for additional tests. A person in touch with the Heat’s
     front office said a worrisome problem surfaced Monday, beyond merely
     a strained calf. Another source said his life was not at risk.

     Asked directly if Bosh had been diagnosed with a blood clot in his
     calf, agent Henry Thomas responded by text: “Too soon for all of
     that…. Too soon to report that.”

   If Bosh again needs blood thinners, he won’t be able to play.

   Hopefully, it doesn’t come to that, but this update doesn’t engender
   much confidence.

Kyle Lowry: 2013 trade to Knicks was ‘done’

   the ball as Toure Murry #23 of the New York Knicks defends in the first
   half during an NBA basketball game at Madison Square Garden on April.

   The Knicks and Raptors engaged in [152]protracted trade discussions
   about [153]Kyle Lowry during the 2013-14 season.

   But the deal reportedly fell through when [154]Knicks owner James Dolan
   – fearful of getting fleeced again by Raptors general manager Masai
   Ujiri, who dealt New York both [155]Andrea Bargnani and, while running
   the Nuggets, [156]Carmelo Anthony – intervened.

   Just how close was the trade?

   Lowry, [157]via Jeff Zillgitt of USA Today:

     “That deal was done,” Lowry told USA TODAY Sports about a trade that
     would’ve sent him to the Knicks, and the Raptors would have received
     [158]Metta World Peace, [159]Iman Shumpert and a future first-round
     draft pick.

   Lowry, who was just entering stardom at that time, has continued to
   progress. He’s one of the NBA’s top guards – precisely the type of
   point guard New York still needs.

   Just because the Knicks traded first-round picks too freely previously
   doesn’t mean they should have stopped dealing them. Lowry would have
   been well worth it.

   Dolan really out-thought himself on this one.

   The Nets general-managing search reportedly had a [170]few frontrunners
   last week: Bryan Colangelo, Arturas Karnisovas, Sean Marks.

   Now, those three have a slightly different label: finalists.

   Chris Broussard of ESPN:

     Source: Nets decision on new GM likely by the end of this week.
     Bryan Colangelo, Arturas Karnisovas, Sean Marks the finalists.

     — Chris Broussard (@Chris_Broussard) [171]February 15, 2016

   This makes it sounds as if the Nets could hire someone Friday – a day
   after the trade deadline. Ridiculous? Or just ridiculous enough for
   Brooklyn?

   It’s far more important the Nets find the best general manager
   available rather than have someone before the deadline, but there’s no
   reason this process should have dragged so long. The [172]Nets fired
   Billy King more than a month ago, and they probably thought about it
   for longer before that.

   Or maybe not.

   With Mikhail Prokhorov in charge, [173]this needn’t be sensible.

   Really, it’s a wonder the Nets have such a reasonable list of
   finalists.

Could next Knicks coach be Tom Thibodeau? Luke Walton? Patrick Ewing? A look at
                              potential candidates

   Now that Derek Fisher has been [33]shown the door at Madison Square
   Garden, the time for speculation on who will take over the always-hot
   seat at the end of the Knicks bench has begun.

   TOM THIBODEAU

   The 58-year-old is the best available coach by a mile. He squeezed more
   out of the Bulls than anybody else in the post-Jordan era, developing
   Derrick Rose, Jimmy Butler and Joakim Noah into stars while going
   255-139 in five seasons. He served as an assistant in New York and
   Boston during the most successful times those franchises had in the
   last 20 years.

   His involvement with USA Basketball also establishes the all-important
   link to Kevin Durant.

   Thibodeau is part of the Jeff Van Gundy coaching tree, which has often
   worked in direct competition with Jackson and, for some reason, hasn’t
   endeared itself to James Dolan. Let’s just say Jackson’s interest was
   lukewarm, at best, when asked specifically about reaching out to
   Thibodeau.

   ISOLA: [34]JACKSON FIRING FISHER A LOSS, THIBODEAU WOULD BE WIN

   KURT RAMBIS

   He’s getting an audition now and has been at Phil Jackson’s side for
   years. He hasn’t shown himself to be a winner as a head coach — 56-145
   — but he also hasn’t exactly been blessed with talent (though he did go
   24-13 leading the Lakers as a bridge coach between Del Harris and Phil
   Jackson).

   Tom Thibodeau is the best available coach as Knicks job opens up.

Tom Thibodeau is the best available coach as Knicks job opens up.

   He also checks the necessary boxes from the Zen Master, who portrayed
   Rambis as the anti-Derek Fisher for having a relaxed personality.
   Rambis’ connection to Jackson extends to their respective significant
   others, Jeanie Buss and Linda Rambis are close.

   [35]A TIMELINE OF DEREK FISHER'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE KNICKS

   LUKE WALTON

   While technically 0-0 as a head coach, he was at the helm when the
   Warriors got off to a 39-4 start while [36]Steve Kerr was sidelined
   with back problems. Jackson loved Walton as a player in his system with
   the Lakers — a gifted passing forward who could move the ball in the
   triangle offense — winning two titles in Los Angeles, so he understands
   the offense Phil wants to run, which is nothing like what the Warriors
   are doing as they run roughshod over the NBA.

Patrick Ewing.

   PATRICK EWING

   The Knicks have never shown an inclination to bring Ewing aboard — save
   for a token offer to coach their D-League team in 2012 — as they’ve
   changed coaches 10 times since he retired in 2002.

   It’s not like he lacks experience, either. Ewing has built up a resume
   as an assistant coach and is currently working for Michael Jordan’s
   Hornets in Charlotte.

   He expressed interest in the Knicks job when it was open in 2014 —
   [38]“I’d love to bo back to New York,” he said then — and lamented what
   he percieved as a big man bias as Mark Jackson, Jason Kidd, Steve Kerr
   and Fisher, all guards, all made the jump from playing straight into
   coaching.

   [39]FIVE CARMELO ANTHONY TRADES THAT COULD WORK

   BRIAN SHAW

   He worked and played under Jackson and owns a strong grasp of the
   triangle, so he delivers on a level of familiarity with the boss. Shaw
   had a rough stint in his one go-around as head coach with the Nuggets
   recently, lasting less than two seasons with a 56-85 record.

   Shaw was a flop in Denver (56-85 in parts of two seasons), and his big
   idea as head coach was to cancel morning shootarounds because NBA
   players don’t like to wake up early for them, a plan he stuck with even
   after his point guard, Ty Lawson, was busted for drunk driving.

   But previous to that disappointment Shaw was lauded for his work as an
   assistant with the Pacers and Lakers, becoming a favorite among players
   like Kobe Bryant and David West.

   [40]HOW PAST KNICKS HEAD COACHES FARED IN THEIR DEBUTS

   FILE Jason Miller

David Blatt.

   DAVID BLATT

   He was fired while the Cavs were 30-11 in what looks from the outside
   as a [41]LeBron James-led uprising. That’s a bad look for Blatt, since
   Carmelo Anthony and James are tight and star players certainly have
   input, if not influence, on coaching maneuvers.

   Blatt came up in the Princeton offense — playing with Knicks GM Steve
   Mills at the Ivy League school in the 1970s — which the triangle is an
   offshoot of, but the principles aren’t exactly interchangeable (Ask
   Mike Brown how the triangle-to-Princeton switch worked with the Lakers
   in 2012).

   Maybe Mills can put in a good word for his old teammate.

   SCOTT BROOKS

   The former Thunder coach is widely credited for his work with young
   players, as his supporters point to the development of Durant (a check
   in his favor), Russell Westbrook and James Harden under him after OKC
   fired P.J. Carlesimo and promoted Brooks. Serge Ibaka and Steven Adams
   also made strides under the former Knicks backup guard. With Kristaps
   Porzingis the centerpiece of the Knicks' future, Brooks' track record
   with youngsters is another mark in his favor.

   But his critics will say that while he had a hand in developing those
   All-Star players, he didn't grow as a coach. The Thunder's offense
   lacked innovation and one trip to the NBA Finals in parts of seven
   seasons, with the talent he had available, is seen as a shortcoming.

Vinny Del Negro.

   VINNY DEL NEGRO

   Certainly not a “wow” candidate, but he’s 26 games over .500 as a head
   coach (210-184) with the Bulls and Clippers and guys with a record like
   that generally get a second shot.

   He never played for Jackson or in a triangle system, so those are marks
   against him, and if Anthony asks Chris Paul about him, it’s probably
   not good for Vinny. They clashed in L.A. and Del Negro has come
   thisclose to saying that Paul got him fired after a 56-win season.

   MARK JACKSON

   He has ties to New York as a Brooklynite and former Knicks point guard
   in the 80s, but his last coaching stint didn’t end well in Golden State
   amid riffs with assistants and ownership — most of it centered on
   Jackson’s inflexibility. The Warriors’ unprecedented success after
   Jackson’s departure doesn’t reflect well on him either. Jackson’s been
   working as an ESPN analyst for the last two seasons.

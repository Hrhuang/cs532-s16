Sports And Energy Drink Consumption Damages Tooth Enamel, Study Suggests

   Sports drinks and energy drinks aren't just a [82]source of sugar for
   kids -- they could also be responsible for tooth enamel damage that
   increases the risk of cavities and decay, according to new research.

   A study in the [83]journal General Dentistry showed that tooth enamel
   is damaged after being exposed to sports drinks or energy drinks for
   just five days, with energy drinks causing two times as much enamel
   damage as the sports drinks.

   "Teens regularly come into my office with these types of symptoms [of
   tooth decay, sensitivity and cavities], but they don't know why,"
   Academy of General Dentistry spokesperson Jennifer Bone, DDS, MAGD,
   said [84]in a statement. "We review their diet and snacking habits and
   then we discuss their consumption of these beverages. They don't
   realize that something as seemingly harmless as a sports or energy
   drink can do a lot of damage to their teeth."

   For the study, researchers from Southern Illinois University School of
   Dentistry looked at the levels of acidity in nine different energy
   drinks and 13 different sports drinks. They found that not all acidity
   levels were the same between brands, nor were they the same between
   flavors within the brands.

   Then, the researchers soaked tooth enamel samples in each sports or
   energy drink. The samples were soaked for 15 minutes in each drink, and
   then were soaked for two hours in artificial saliva, for four times a
   day for five days.

   The researchers found that enamel damage was evident after just five
   days.

   Bone recommended that people who drink sports and energy drinks rinse
   out their mouths with water or chew a sugar-free piece of gum right
   after drinking the beverages. In addition, she said to wait at least an
   hour to brush your teeth after drinking the beverages, lest your
   toothbrush spreads the acid from the beverages all over your teeth.

   Recently, a study showed just how [85]damaging soda is to the teeth,
   too. LiveScience reported on a study also published in General
   Dentistry showing how the citric and phosphoric acids found in sodas
   are [86]corrosive to teeth.

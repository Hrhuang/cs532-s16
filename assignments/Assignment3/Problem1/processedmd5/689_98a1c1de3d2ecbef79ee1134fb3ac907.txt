Jerry Jones’ Criticism Of Tony Romo Just Another Devious Game Of Politics

   Sep 21, 2014 | Posted by [40]Ryan Bush | [41]Jerry Jones, [42]Ryan
   Bush, [43]Tony Romo | [44]0 comments |

   Remember when nobody at Valley Ranch would dare criticize Tony Romo?

   Of a certainty, those days are long gone.  These are the new-age
   Cowboys, a team that pounds opponents into the turf on Sundays, and
   then rips their star players during the week.  Suddenly, Valley Ranch
   is a camp of accountability.  And Jerry Jones is leading the charge.

   As weeks go, it was a good one for Jerry Jones.  Starting up in
   Nashville where the patrons at LP Field affectionately chanted his name
   in the closing moments of Dallas’ 26-10 victory, it has managed to
   stretch over these last handful of days on the wings of a verbal
   assault on Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo.

   Jerry, it seems, is playing hardball with his quarterback these days,
   almost to the point of being downright negative.  This, to a fanbase
   that wants to suggest “organizational turnaround” after each Cowboys
   triumph, was exactly what they wanted to hear.

   Back when Romo was just a pup, it was Bill Parcells who nagged him
   constantly about one thing or another.  The belief has held strong
   since Bill’s departure that Romo has missed that strong voice in the
   locker room, as he has been awarded a record contract, and what some
   might consider as absolute control of the Dallas offense, all while
   leading the Cowboys on an 8-8 trek to nowhere.

   The specter of Parcells has certainly grown smaller in the rear-view
   mirror over time, while Romo is large and in charge of a Cowboys team
   that continues to struggle.

   Concerns over Romo’s well-being hit a new high this past week, albeit
   in the aftermath of a Cowboys win.  Through two games Romo’s
   performances fall in the category of thud and dud.  He was both
   inefficient and awful against San Francisco, tossing three first-half
   interceptions which effectively ended the contest, and then turned in a
   much quieter day versus Tennessee, though he uncharacteristically
   short-armed several throws.

   What’s wrong with Romo?  What could possibly be plaguing America’s
   quarterback?

   There with all of the answers was the second-coming of Parcells, as the
   Cowboys owner tackled this subject with as much direct purpose as to
   unnerve all of us.  Jerry ended the international debate, citing not
   only rust as the prime culprit in Romo’s slow start, but sloppy
   footwork as well.

   That Jerry.  He not only sees all, he tells all.

   Of course, considering the timeline of events over the past few years,
   finding Romo in Jerry’s doghouse was anything but expected.

   Tony loses games, and owner gives him a fat new contract.  He goes out
   and helps to beat a Titans team on the road and suddenly Jerry is
   singing a different tune.

   Is Jerry a changed man?

   Don’t you believe it.

   This is a classic case of politics that Jones is playing right now,
   trying his very best to save the face of the franchise from a world of
   heartache.  Yes, that would be his face, in case you were speculating
   the point.  Tony may pull a few strings from time to time, but he’s got
   a long, long way to go before he can become puppet master.

   Jerry’s greatest talent as head honcho of all things football is an
   ability to play a game of smoke and mirrors with the public.  And,
   believe me, never a more devious mind existed in this arena.

   If you will look closely at the Cowboys’ injury list for today’s game
   against St. Louis, you will find Romo marked down as probable, with
   some sort of back ailment.  This is the third consecutive week in which
   he has been on the injured list.  And the Cowboys owner won’t talk
   about it.

   Sure, he’ll go so far as to say that Romo is rusty and has struggled
   with his footwork, but won’t go anywhere near saying that his
   quarterback is actually hurt.  Jones has said more than once that Romo
   is one-hundred percent healthy.

   Romo would hardly pass the eye-test with such favorable regard after
   the first two weeks of play.  His passes lack zip, his accuracy is
   inconsistent, and his throwing motion has often had a hitch on the
   follow through.  Throw in the fact that Romo limps while rolling to his
   right, and that he has been seen grimacing several times on the Dallas
   sideline during games, and there is little reason to believe that the
   Cowboys quarterback is anything close to being his old self.

   Jones can deal with facts when it comes to relating to the league
   front-office.  He doesn’t have any choice.  Unless your name is
   Belichik, there’s no reason to try to play games with your team’s
   injury report.  The NFL doesn’t look kindly upon it.

   But splitting straws in the public arena is an undertaking Jones
   figures to be well worth the time, considering what’s all at stake.

   Jones’ recent investments are of the bold and dangerous variety, which
   is just the kind he prefers.  Gambling big and winning big leaves a
   prime platform for Jerry to stand on and gloat, something we all know
   he can be partial to.  He made it look good when Jimmy Johnson was
   beside him, but has lost every bet since.

   (Go ahead.  It’s safe to draw conclusions.)

   His latest wager just happens to be placed on the health and welfare of
   his franchise quarterback.  As if it wasn’t enough for Jones to watch
   Johnny Manziel slip by in the draft, he let every other quarterback
   walk as well.  He not only stated his belief that Romo could play
   another five years, but was willing to prove it.

   Never let it be said that Jones was full of hot air in this regard.  He
   was more than willing to tempt fate.  So it’s no to Johnny Football,
   goodbye to Kyle Orton, and an indifferent air toward any and all
   up-and-coming gunslingers.

   The only credible arm in the Cowboys bullpen right now is one Brandon
   Weeden who, if you’re listening to Cowboys assistant coaches, is
   anything but a prime prospect at this date.

   It’s Romo or bust this season for the Cowboys, and Jerry isn’t inclined
   to admit even the possibility of failure.  That’s why he – and every
   other Ranch hand – won’t even speculate upon the fact that Romo is an
   injured quarterback right now.  And why it’s OK to harp on Romo’s
   “rust” and poor technique.

   Jones knows no end to promoting the well-being of his franchise
   quarterback.  In 2000, there was Troy Aikman to look out for, another
   34-year old veteran with five years still remaining on a back-loaded
   contract.  And when a hard-hitting Eagles defense knocked Aikman from
   the season-opener in Irving with a concussion, the situation appeared
   to have been taken out of Jones’ hands.

   Already with a questionable back, Aikman was now dealing with severe
   headaches as the team prepared to travel to Arizona for their next
   game.  As reports began circulating that backup quarterback Randall
   Cunningham would start, there were many in the media who believed that
   Aikman was playing his last season of professional football.

   That’s when Jerry pulled a PR rabbit out of the hat.  Rather than have
   the fans moaning over a broken quarterback and a broken franchise,
   Jones let it be known that his star quarterback was on the inactive
   list due to an “inner-ear infection.”

   Sudden?  Yes.  Believable?  Not really.

   Jones became the brunt of many an “ear infection” joke over the next
   several days, as Aikman sat out the next two games.

   After what transpired with Aikman, Jones can’t afford wind of a
   possible injury to his quarterback hitting the national airwaves.  Not
   if he wants to maintain the tough-guy image he has enjoyed building
   this past week.

   Right now, Jones is playing this charade for all its worth, because
   without it fans can’t believe in him, nor the team he has such high
   hopes for.

About Ryan Bush

   At the age of 18, Ryan Bush began writing a weekly column about the
   Dallas Cowboys for several small-town newspapers across Texas.
   Homeschooled through High School, his talent was initially recognized
   by H. Leon Smith, then owner of The Clifton Record, a
   multi-award-winning newspaper in central Texas. After three years, his
   literary pursuit and passion for the Cowboys led him to write Decade of
   Futility, his first book. Ryan is currently working on additional
   projects about the Dallas Cowboys to be published in the future. Ryan
   Bush is available for interviews. Please contact Ben Bush Jr. (254)

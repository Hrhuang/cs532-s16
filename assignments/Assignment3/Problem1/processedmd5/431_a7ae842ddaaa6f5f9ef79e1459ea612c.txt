   The Cherokee County Sports Hall of Fame announced its 14th class of
   inductees Thursday.
   The class includes former Sequoyah standout Adam Benton, Sequoyah
   softball coach Todd Morrissey, Etowah’s Wayne Moss and Bryant Rogowski
   and Cherokee’s Cindy Richards Woody. The Sequoyah wrestling teams from
   1990-2000, including the state championship teams of ’96 and ’99, will
   also be honored at the annual enshrinement banquet May 6.
   Benton was a three-year standout for the Sequoyah basketball team who
   still holds team records for career points (1,501), points in a season
   (576), season scoring average (23.1), points in a game (42), free
   throws made in a game (16) and two-point field goals made in a game
   (13), more than 20 years after his graduation.
   Benton also made an impact on the football field. He began playing
   quarterback for the Chiefs as a junior and finished with 3,029 passing
   yards and 25 touchdowns. He was named first team all-county in 1992 and
   ’93 as both a quarterback and punter.
   Benton earned a scholarship to play basketball at Providence, but he
   transferred to Akron after his freshman year. He was named a co-captain
   of the Zips for the 1996-97 season.
   Benton died in 2003 at the age of 27.
   At the same time Benton was starring at Sequoyah, Moss was doing the
   same for Etowah.
   Moss started on the varsity basketball team all four years and was
   voted a team captain for his final three seasons. During his sophomore,
   junior and senior seasons, Moss led the Eagles in points, assists and
   steals, and he was named first team all-county three times.
   Moss ranked near the top of all three points, assists and steals
   columns when he graduated, ranking second with nearly 1,100 career
   points.
   He received a scholarship to play at Shorter, where he was named an
   NAIA academic all-American for the 1996-97 and 1997-98 seasons. Moss
   now works as a financial planner.
   Morrissey got his start as a softball coach in California in 1989
   before coming to Sequoyah in 2003 as an assistant. In 2006, he took the
   head-coaching job with the Lady Chiefs’ softball team and enjoyed
   immediate success, going 33-9 record with the Class AAAA state
   championship.
   In 10 seasons under Morrissey, Sequoyah went 206-91, made the playoffs
   seven times and reached the elite eight twice. In all, he sent 18
   players to play in college before retiring from coaching after the 2015
   season.
   As a freshman, Rogowski was named the most improved wrestler from
   Etowah’s junior varsity team — a sign of things to come.
   He won the same award the following year as a sophomore for the varsity
   team, finishing 25-5 on his way to a region championship and state
   quarterfinal appearance. Rogowski captured another region championship
   his junior year and also returned to the state quarterfinals while
   finishing the season 26-2-1.
   Rogowski took his biggest step as a senior, when he won his third
   region championship and became just the fifth wrestler form Etowah, and
   the ninth from Cherokee County, to win a state championship.
   He graduated in 1989 with an 80-8-1 career record, earning a
   scholarship to Chattanooga, where he was in the lineup for a Mocs team
   that won the Southern Conference championship four times.
   Rogowski is currently an assistant wrestling coach at Stephens County
   High School in Toccoa.
   Woody was a two-sport standout at Cherokee and received offers to play
   both softball and basketball at Shorter.
   As a basketball player, she lettered all four seasons, winning the
   Cherokee Warriorette and the Best Percentage Foul Shot trophies.
   In softball, Woody was a starter on region championship teams in 1988
   and ’89, and she was awarded the Christian Athlete Award. She also
   played at the club level throughout high school, starting on district
   and state championship teams.
   Woody stuck to softball at Shorter, where she was a starter from
   1990-93 and earned Georgia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference
   all-conference honors her final three years. She was also named team
   MVP in 1991 and ’92 — a season in which she batted .500 and recorded 61
   hits.
   Woody returned to Cherokee County to teach, but she died in 1995 of
   cystic fibrosis — which she had for much of her life, even through her
   athletic career. She was 24.

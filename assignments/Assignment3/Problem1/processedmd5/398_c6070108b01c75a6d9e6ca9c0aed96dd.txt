   Some moves are known for their utility. Others are known for their
   style. Still others are known because internet culture has created
   memes out of them.

   We are looking at special moves that are key to specific characters,
   are the biggest part of their repertoire and are the most iconic in
   video games. We’re here to bring you the 10 signature fighting game
   moves.

   10. The Nut Punch – Mortal Kombat

   Johnny Cage is so badass, he does a split specifically for the reason
   of punching you in the balls. The Nut Punch has shown up in every
   Mortal Kombat game, movie, animated series, and more.

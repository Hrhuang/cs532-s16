   This Is How Hillary Clinton Gets the Coverage She Wants

   Hillary Clinton’s supporters [44]often argue [45]that mainstream
   [46]political reporters are incapable of covering her positively—or
   even fairly. While it may be true that the political press doesn’t
   always write exactly what Clinton would like, emails recently obtained
   by Gawker offer a case study in how her prodigious and sophisticated
   press operation manipulates reporters into amplifying her desired
   message—in this case, down to the very word that The Atlantic’s Marc
   Ambinder used to describe an important policy speech.

   [47]The emails in question, which were exchanged by Ambinder, then
   [48]serving as The Atlantic’s politics editor, and Philippe Reines,
   Clinton’s notoriously combative spokesman and consigliere, turned up
   thanks to a Freedom of Information Act request we filed in 2012 (and
   which we are currently [49]suing the State Department over). The same
   request previously revealed that Politico’s chief White House
   correspondent, Mike Allen, [50]promised to deliver positive coverage of
   Chelsea Clinton, and, in a separate exchange, [51]permitted Reines to
   ghost-write an item about the State Department for Politico’s Playbook
   newsletter. Ambinder’s emails with Reines demonstrate the same kind of
   transactional reporting, albeit to a much more legible degree: In them,
   you can see Reines “blackmailing” Ambinder into describing a Clinton
   speech as “muscular” in exchange for early access to the transcript. In
   other words, Ambinder outsourced his editorial judgment about the
   speech to a member of Clinton’s own staff.

   On the morning of July 15, 2009, Ambinder [52]sent Reines a blank email
   with the subject line, “Do you have a copy of HRC’s speech to share?”
   His question concerned a speech Clinton [53]planned to give later that
   day at the Washington, D.C. office of the Council on Foreign Relations,
   an influential think tank. Three minutes after Ambinder’s initial
   email, Reines replied with three words: “on two conditions.” After
   Ambinder responded with “ok,” Reines sent him a list of those
   conditions:

   Advertisement

     From: [Philippe Reines]
     Sent: Wednesday, July 15 2009 10:06 AM
     To: Ambinder, Marc
     Subject: Re: Do you have a copy of HRC’s speech to share?

     3 [conditions] actually

     1) You in your own voice describe them as “muscular”

     2) You note that a look at the CFR seating plan shows that all the
     envoys — from Holbrooke to Mitchell to Ross — will be arrayed in
     front of her, which in your own clever way you can say certainly not
     a coincidence and meant to convey something

     3) You don’t say you were blackmailed!

   One minute later, Ambinder responded:

     From: Ambinder, Marc
     Sent: Wednesday, July 15, 2009 10:07 AM
     To: Philippe Reines
     Subject: RE: Do you have a copy of HRC’s speech to share?

     got it

   Ambinder made good on his word. The opening paragraph of the article he
   wrote later that day, under the headline “[54]Hillary Clinton’s ‘Smart
   Power’ Breaks Through,” precisely followed Reines’ instructions:

   Sponsored

     When you think of President Obama’s foreign policy, think of
     Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. That’s the message behind a
     muscular speech that Clinton is set to deliver today to the Council
     on Foreign Relations. The staging gives a clue to its purpose:
     seated in front of Clinton, subordinate to Clinton, in the first
     row, will be three potentially rival power centers: envoys Richard
     Holbrooke and George Mitchell, and National Security Council senior
     director Dennis Ross.

   Based on other emails released in the same batch we received,
   Ambinder’s warm feelings toward Clinton may have made him uniquely
   susceptible to Reines’ editing suggestions. On July 26, 2009, [55]he
   wrote to Reines to congratulate his boss about her appearance on Meet
   the Press:

     From: Ambinder, Marc
     Sent: Sunday, July 26, 2009 12:05 PM
     To: Philippe Reines
     Subject: she kicked A

     on MTP

   On [56]November 29, 2010, he sent along another congratulatory note,
   apparently in regard to a press conference Clinton [57]had held that
   day to address the publication of thousands of State Department cables
   by WikiLeaks:

     From: Ambinder, Marc
     Sent: Monday, November 29, 2010 12:05 PM
     To: Philippe Reines
     Subject: This is an awesome presser...

     She is PITCH f#$*& PERFECT on this stuff.

   The emails quoted above are particularly remarkable given Ambinder’s
   understanding of Clinton’s press strategy, as he articulated in a
   column for The Week last year. Predicting how Clinton’s widely
   documented aversion to reporters would play out in the 2016
   presidential race, [58]Ambinder wrote, “The Clinton campaign will use
   the press instrumentally. ... Good news for us, though: The reporters
   covering Clinton are going to find ways to draw her out anyway, because
   they’re really good, they’ll give her no quarter, and they’ll provide a
   good source of accountability tension [sic] until Walker (or whomever)
   emerges from the maelstrom.”

   When asked for comment about his correspondence with Reines, Ambinder
   wrote in an email to Gawker, “I don’t remember much about anything, but
   I do remember once writing about how powerful FOIA is, especially as a
   mechanism to hold everyone in power, even journalists, accountable.”
   When asked to elaborate, he followed up with a longer message:

   Advertisement

     Philippe and I generally spoke on the phone and followed up by
     email. The exchange is probably at best an incomplete record of what
     went down. That said, the transactional nature of such interactions
     always gave me the willies.... Since I can’t remember the exact
     exchange I can’t really muster up a defense of the art, and frankly,
     I don’t really want to. I will say this: whatever happened here
     reflects my own decisions, and no one else’s.

   In a subsequent phone exchange, Ambinder added:

     It made me uncomfortable then, and it makes me uncomfortable today.
     And when I look at that email record, it is a reminder to me of why
     I moved away from all that. The Atlantic, to their credit, never
     pushed me to do that, to turn into a scoop factory. In the fullness
     of time, any journalist or writer who is confronted by the prospect,
     or gets in the situation where their journalism begins to feel
     transactional, should listen to their gut feeling and push away from
     that.

     Being scrupulous at all times will not help you get all the scoops,
     but it will help you sleep at night. At no point at The Atlantic did
     I ever feel the pressure to make transactional journalism the norm.

   Ambinder emphasized that the emails did not capture the totality of his
   communication with Reines, and said they were not indicative of his
   normal reporting techniques. When asked if the exchange was typical of
   the magazine’s reporting and editing process, a spokesperson for The
   Atlantic told Gawker: “No, this is not typical, and it goes against our
   standards.”

   Reines didn’t respond when we asked if he engaged in similar
   transactions with other reporters covering the State Department. But on
   the day of his trade with Ambinder, at least one other journalist used
   Reines’ preferred adjective—“muscular”—to describe the speech at the
   Council on Foreign Relations. That [59]reporter was none other than
   Mike Allen of Politico:
   This Is How Hillary Clinton Gets the Coverage She Wants

   Allen even took note of the seating arrangement, just as Reines had
   requested of Ambinder:

     A look at the CFR’s guest seating chart shows that arrayed in the
     front row will be top members of her team — the envoys she has
     called her “force multipliers”: Richard Holbrooke, George Mitchell,
     Dennis Ross, Philip Goldberg and Stephen Bosworth.

   We can’t say for sure that Reines implored Allen to describe Clinton’s
   speech as “muscular” and emphasize where particular audience members
   were seated, but that kind of request would hardly be out of the
   ordinary. As we noted above, Allen allowed Reines to ghost-write an
   item for his Playbook newsletter; and, in the course of attempting to
   secure an interview with Chelsea Clinton, told Reines he was prepared
   to submit interview questions to Clinton’s team in advance for their
   approval.

   Allen referred our questions to Politico’s spokesperson, who told
   Gawker via email: “Mike’s preview of this speech includes multiple
   ‘aides say’ qualifiers and is transparent in that it’s based on
   ‘prepared remarks’ and a ‘seating chart.’” (If Allen and Reines did
   indeed email about Clinton’s speech, however, we expect to receive a
   copy of their correspondence in a subsequent batch as the State
   Department continues to process our request.)

   In any case, Reines’ strategy worked out nicely. For an article
   aggregating Allen’s piece, New York magazine quoted his use of
   “muscular” in the headline, and [60]even commissioned an illustration
   of Clinton wearing the arms of a body builder.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The most recent batch of emails revealed another notable sausage-making
   exchange between Reines and a prominent reporter. In several emails
   sent in early September 2009, Mark Halperin—then at Time, now at
   Bloomberg News—[61]appears to have arranged for a computer
   pre-configured with Microsoft’s Outlook calendaring software to be
   delivered to Reines’ house in Washington, D.C., so that Reines would be
   able to open particular documents in his possession, [62]including
   Hillary Clinton’s travel schedules during the 2008 presidential
   campaign, and relay their contents to Halperin. In one email, the
   reporter writes to Reines:

     the computer is ready to be delivered. I could have it there in
     20-25 minutes

     It has a newly downloaded version of Outlook, which has not been
     installed, because it has to be done linked to an email. I am
     hoping/assuming you can do that.

     Is now a good time to have it brought over? Should it be left with a
     doorman or left upstairs?

   It’s unclear from the exchange whether Reines actually provided any
   documents to Halperin or simply relayed the information therein. But
   perhaps the more interesting aspect of Reines and Halperin’s
   correspondence is that, the day after Halperin had the computer
   delivered, Reines began asking Halperin whether he and his co-author
   John Heilemann would include him in Game Change, the book-turned-movie
   they were writing about the 2008 campaign: [63]“Do I have a big enough
   role to warrant a role in the movie, a la Jeremy Bash in Recount?” To
   which Halperin responds: “Well, the first response is, do you want
   that?” The thread [64]continued:

     Reines: “Yes, I want to be an amalgam like he was!”

     Halperin: “ok then. the book doesn’t do amalgams. but the movie just
     might. let me puzzle on that.”

     Reines: “There’s gotta be a scene where I hand the phone to CVC:
     That’s good TV.”

     Halperin: “agreed, although hard to get your name in the film in
     said scene.”

     Reines: “True”

     Halperin: “we could make you the kennedy character or the mills
     character. going all postal on the wednesday call.”

   In the end, Reines rated only two mentions in [65]the finished book—on
   pages 46-47 and page 52 in the paperback—and none in the movie.
   (Neither Reines nor Halperin responded to a request for comment.)

   Below, you’ll find highlights from the last two rounds of Reines emails
   we received from the State Department’s FOIA office. (The release from
   December 31 consisted of only 211 pages, so we consolidated it with the
   January release.) You can read and search through [71]the rest of the
   emails on DocumentCloud.

   [72]Page 58 — Reines emails Andy Alexander, then the ombudsman of The
   Washington Post, to complain about sexism in [73]Howard Kurtz’s profile
   of Chuck Todd “What does it say when a paper’s ombudsman takes a paper
   to task for sexist writing and then only days later features a piece
   laced with so much blatant sexism that it’s laughable (profile of Chuck
   Todd)?”

   [74]Page 75 — After asking, on [75]page 72, for quotes about Politico’s
   newsroom culture, Jeremy Peters of The New York Times praises Reines’
   response (“If a lightbulb is out that’s a story”): “That’s brilliant.
   You should totally let me use that on the record. … That’s great.
   Anything else you can recall like that—their greatest hits of
   non-news—would be great.”

   [76]Page 79 — Reines appears to flirt with a Miami-based media
   personality named Tara Gilani: “How did I look in HD?” To which Gilani
   responds: “You look/are the same: cocky, smart ass. Don’t take it as a
   compliment—it’s not.” To which Reines responds: “Oh yeah it is.”

   [77]Pages 110 through [78]111 — Greta van Susteren emails Reines a
   photo of Reines laughing with the subject line: “what is so funny?”

   [79]Page 151 — Van Susteren complains to Reines about a grudge she
   perceives Bill Clinton to be holding against her:

     I think it weird — if bill clinton is holding a grudge against me
     that is really weird I think I may be the only one in media who has
     never been smarmy towards him or repeated stuff that I have heard
     from him or hugh or dorothy etc which I know was said off the record
     because they feel comfortable talking in front of me. I have always
     carefully drawn the line with the clintons (and others) because I
     hate the media trying to destroy. I admire people in public service
     and never do anything rotten to people in govt so it is stunning
     that bill clinton would hold a grudge against me. I will still be
     one hundred percent fair with him (bill richardson did something
     really dirty to me and I have never retaliated — I have continued to
     do my job fair) but I am curious if it is clinton or matt [Bill
     Clinton spokesperson Matt McKenna] thinking he is clinton and
     creating problems.

   [80]Pages 227 and [81]250 — New York Times reporter David Kirkpatrick
   appears to engage in—or deny engaging in—some sort of quote approval
   protocol with Philippe Reines: “I can’t imagine I imagined a quote
   approval since I cleared them all, so as I said, I’m puzzled.”

   [82]Page 518 through [83]519 — These pages contain an unusually large
   redaction, apparently based upon a personal privacy exemption, that
   appears to concern something Reines ate while aboard a State Department
   aircraft.

   [84]Page 551 — Reines asks ABC News reporter Dana Hughes to “add a line
   taking a small poke at ‘BuzzFeed and others’ for getting this wrong” to
   a story Hughes was writing about reports that a swarm of bees had
   attacked Hillary Clinton and her State Department entourage on a
   diplomatic trip to Malawi. Reines adds that he would be “very
   appreciative” of the favor. According to the finished story, Hughes
   [85]appears to have complied with Reines’ request.

   [86]Page 667 — Kimberly Dozier, then at the Associated Press (and now
   at The Daily Beast), appears to allude an interaction she had with
   Michael Hastings in an email to Reines: “I just read the exchange you
   had with another member of the press, who shall remain nameless in this
   email. I’ll tell you my run-in with the same person, over a drink
   sometime, if I run into you at State Dept. event.”

   [87]Page 740 — Tina Brown emails Reines about an upcoming forum called
   “The Hero Summit,” scheduled for November 14-15, 2012 and headlined by
   David Petraeus. However Petraeus [88]does not appear to have attended
   the event, given that he resigned several days prior to it over his
   extramarital affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell.

   [89]Page 748 — Here you can find the official copy of Reines’
   [90]infamous email exchange with Michael Hastings.

   [91]Pages 830 through [92]832 — Reines emails with Maureen Dowd and her
   research assistant, and claims that he was fired that last time he
   helped Maureen Dowd with a column.

   [93]Pages 971 through [94]980 — The State Department redacted the
   entirety of what appears to be ten pages of email correspondence
   between Reines and Carolyn Greenspan Rosen, a producer at Entertainment
   Tonight. The pages are marked with the exemption code “B6,” which is
   used to justify withhold information that, if disclosed, [95]“would
   constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”

   [96]Page 1030 — Greta van Susteren emails Reines: “How come you ignore
   my emails?”

   [97]Page 1082 — Anne Kornblut of The Washington Post emails Reines: “I
   know you’re on the other side of the earth, but if you get bored in a
   meeting, want to send me some examples of politico’s most flagrant
   stupidity or errors?”

   [98]Page 1155 — Tara Palmeri of the New York Post writes to Reines
   about Hillary Clinton’s plans to endorse a candidate in the 2013 New
   York City mayoral race: “I wanted to reach out to you about Hillary’s
   status on Weiner. Last time we chatted you said she would likely
   endorse him for Mayor of New York over Bill de Blasio. In light of
   recent events, will Hillary still endorse Weiner for Mayor?” To which
   Reines responds (after asking Palmeri to identify him as a “friend”):
   “Her support of him remains unchanged.”

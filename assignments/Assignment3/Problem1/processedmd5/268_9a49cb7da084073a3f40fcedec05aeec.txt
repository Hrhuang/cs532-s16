Coldwood Interactive Threaded The Damn Needle With Their New Game ‘Unravel’

   Created by Coldwood Interactive and published by Electronic Arts,
   ‘[40]Unravel‘ is a physics-based puzzle platform game available on the
   XBOX ONE and PS4, starring you as the nimble, highly agile,
   magically-animated red yarn doll Yarny.

     Origin Access & [41]@EAAccess members can try Unravel tomorrow.
     Excited to explore with Yarny? [42]https://t.co/FVbufKiSwi

     — Unravel (@unravel_game) [44]February 3, 2016

   The game trailer, which came out a while ago, shows off some seriously
   kickass CG, and a quick skim of the interweb reveals your main
   objective as Yarny in this game centers on helping the old lady we see
   in the trailer, retrieve her memories. Much like unraveling a ball of
   yarn. Ah, I see what you did there Coldwood, and I like it.

   ide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent

   “Unravel’s” Creative Director, Martin Sahlin says that the yarn that
   makes up Yarny is meant to represent love, and cleverly enough the
   further your character travels away from home, what he loves, the
   quicker you’ll find yourself coming unraveled. ‘Unravel’ also features
   a dialogue/narration-free environment, and instead relies heavily upon
   the profound kind of veg-the-fuck-out, exploration gaming experience
   any solid gaming soundtrack can spur for the gamer in need of a mental
   checkout. Always down for good tunes and pretty puzzles. The game’s
   claim to fame will likely rest on its remarkably refined and polished
   graphics, and the most minute of details allotted to the smallest of
   elements. Then again, if you consider the fact your character’s a tiny
   lil yarn doll, you’ll quickly recognize the indispensable applications
   (platform to jump, piece to an efficient pulley system) you might stand
   to glean from something as otherwise insignificant as an *empty cup of
   coffee.

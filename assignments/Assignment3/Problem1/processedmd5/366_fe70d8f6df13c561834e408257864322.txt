Phaneuf comes to Senators in a blockbuster deal

   The Senators and Maple Leafs didn’t call a truce in the Battle of
   Ontario Tuesday, but they did make a trade, and it was a blockbuster.

   Trying to get back into the playoff race in the East, Senators GM Bryan
   Murray pulled off a massive nine-player deal that brought the club
   former Leafs captain Dion Phaneuf in return. He’ll make his debut
   playing alongside Cody Ceci Wednesday night in the Motor City against
   the Detroit Red Wings.
   [174]Take Our Poll

   The Senators have been looking for someone to play with Ceci all season
   and this will fill that hole. Ottawa sent wingers Milan Michalek and
   Colin Greening, who has spent this season in Binghamton, to Toronto
   along with prospect Tobias Lindberg, struggling blueliner Jared Cowen
   and a second-round pick in 2017.

   Ottawa also acquired minor-league forwards Matt Frattin, Casey Bailey,
   Ryan Rupert and defence prospect Cody Donaghey. Phaneuf is the key to
   the deal and the Senators are hoping with the chance to take the ‘C’
   off his chest he can just play, contribute and provide leadership here.

   Phaneuf was in Calgary and was expected to join the Senators at the
   Detroit hotel Tuesday night.

   “I don’t expect him to come in here and be a saviour,” said Murray,
   trying to relieve some of the pressure Phaneuf felt in the Toronto
   market. “We expect him to come in here and be the hockey player he is.”

       of ‘meh’

   The talks heated up on Saturday when the Leafs were in Ottawa. Toronto
   GM Lou Lamoriello pulled Murray into the coaches offices before the
   morning skate at the Canadian Tire Centre and that’s where it got
   serious.

   The Leafs were happy with the way Phaneuf was contributing but they
   didn’t like the $7-million pricetag. Murray did some homework on
   Phaneuf to make sure he’d be happy here before making the trade. He
   spoke with Phaneuf before he boarded a plane from Calgary to Detroit
   and he was happy.

   “I never had a doubt about Dion’s character,” Murray said. “I know we
   scrutinize people, especially in good markets or big markets, and guys
   that wear the ‘C’ on their sweater. I’ve talked to enough people over
   the years to know (and) I’ve talked (former Leaf and current Senator)
   Clarke MacArthur enough to know.

   “I don’t think I’ve heard one thing other than he’s a real good person,
   competes (and) he wants to win. He’s been in a tough environment. He’s
   been judged very tough in the environment he’s in.”

   MacArthur, who skated Tuesday morning, said he planned to reach out to
   Phaneuf. They are close friends and have stayed in touch.

   “I think he’s going to be great,” MacArthur said. “I had good years
   with him in Toronto. He’s a character guy that we need. He came a long
   way in Toronto. Having to be the captain in a city like that, it’s a
   tough place to play and even tougher to be the guy that takes all the
   heat so for us to get him, I think that solidified a really solid ‘D’
   corps now and we’re excited to get him,” said MacArthur.

   “At the same time it’s a sad day. I was really good buddies with
   (Michalek), he was a great teammate. Everyone’s going to really miss
   those guys … So any of these big trades you always lose good people so
   it’s tough.”

   The Senators will save $1.4 million this season and another $4 million
   next year. Yes, Murray noted money is always a factor but he wanted to
   make a hockey trade that would help the team.
   “First of all, it’s great to make a hockey trade. We usually don’t do
   that,” said Murray. “We usually worry about everything else.

   “From our point of view, it’s a trade that will give us a little more
   security on the back end. I hear people talk all the time that we’re
   dreadful in our own end and we haven’t been great. We’re getting better
   and we believe this will be a good addition in that process.

   “It’s about getting an experienced leader, a good person, hard-working,
   competitive guy to add to the mix in our top four.”

   It seems odd that the Senators made a deal with their arch-rival,
   though. They haven’t been dance partners in the past but Murray and
   Lamoriello have been around long enough that they don’t have to worry
   about what anybody might think. They both wanted to do what was best
   for their teams.

   “It helps them. It helps us. Those are good deals and then maybe you
   can make a deal in the future,” said Murray. “We’ll battle them on the
   ice. They’ll battle us on the ice.

   “We’ll try to compete to beat them every game and they’ll do likewise
   but, at the end of the day, we’re in a business that’s about winning
   and all I’m trying to do is help the Ottawa Senators be a winner.”

   The Senators felt they made a step in that direction Tuesday.

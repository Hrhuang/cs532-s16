   Wesley Freshman Anthony Simpson and Christopher Newport Freshman
   Jonathan Graham Earn CAC Men's Track & Field Weekly Honors
   Feb 09, 2016

   YORK, Pa. -- Wesley freshman Anthony Simpson and Christopher Newport
   freshman Jonathan Graham were named the CAC Men's Track & Field
   Athletes of the Week for Feb. 9, 2016 following record-breaking
   performances last weekend.

Track Athlete of the Week

   Anthony Simpson | Wesley | Fr.

   Baltimore, Md. | Mervo

   Wesley freshman Anthony Simpson was chosen as the CAC Track Athlete of
   the Week after setting a CAC record in the 60-meter dash at the Frank
   Colden Invitational. Simpson raced to a time of 6.77 seconds in the 60
   meters, breaking Tyler Austin's (Salisbury) mark of 6.84 from 2014. His
   time earned him first place in the meet and ranks him first in the
   nation this year. The sprinter also placed second in the 200 meters at
   22.62, the fourth fastest time by a CAC student-athlete this season.

Field Athlete of the Week

   Jonathan Graham | Christopher Newport | Fr.

   King George, Va. | King George

   Christopher Newport freshman Jonathan Graham was named the CAC Field
   Athlete of the Week after setting a new CAC record in the pole vault
   for the third time this year. Graham set the CAC indoor pole vault
   record after eclipsing 15'-3" during the Vince Brown Invitational on
   Saturday at the Freeman Center. That effort topped his own conference
   record of 4.61 meters, which he set during the CNU Triangular on Jan.
   15. His performance on Saturday also established a new school record,
   placed him first overall in the meet and 23rd nationally.

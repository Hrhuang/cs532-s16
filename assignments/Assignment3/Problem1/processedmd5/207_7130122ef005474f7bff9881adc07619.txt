Game of Thrones trees: White lines have people seeing red

     * 9 February 2016
     * From the section [61]Northern Ireland

   DRD admitted that a contractor mistakenly painted the white lines on
   the road under the trees on Tuesday Image copyright PACEMAKER Image
   caption DRD admitted that a contractor mistakenly painted the white
   lines on the road under the trees on Tuesday

   They feature in Game of Thrones and are one of Northern Ireland's most
   famous natural landmarks, but fans of north Antrim's Dark Hedges are
   concerned that road markings painted by mistake have spoiled their
   look.

   The iconic tunnel of trees on the Bregagh Road near Armoy features as
   the Kingsroad in the smash-hit HBO television series.

   However, the Department for Regional Development (DRD) has admitted
   that a contractor mistakenly painted white lines on the road under the
   trees.

   It is the second setback for the Dark Hedges in just over a week.
   Image copyright Bob McCallion Image caption The department says it will
   remove the lines on Wednesday

   At the end of January, [62]Storm Gertrude ripped up two of the
   200-year-old beeches that overhang the road and damaged a third.

   While nothing can be done to replace the trees, the DRD has promised to
   rectify the contractor's error.

   "Following completion of a small resurfacing scheme along a 200-metre
   stretch of the Bregagh Road at the Dark Hedges, the white lining at the
   junction with the Ballinlea Road was extended in error," a spokesperson
   said.

   "The contractor has since been instructed to remove the line, and we
   expect this to be completed by tomorrow [Wednesday].
   Image copyright PACEMAKER Image caption Fans of the Dark Hedges are
   happy that the road markings are being removed

   "The white lining will be burned off by the contractor. Whilst there is
   the potential for some residual marking to the carriageway as a result
   of the removal, we are confident that, given the time of year and the
   number of vehicles using the Bregagh Road that any such marks will
   disappear soon.

   "DRD will continue to monitor the condition of the surface over the
   coming weeks, and will take further action to repair the road if
   necessary."

   Heather Morrison of the Dark Hedges Preservation Trust told the BBC: "I
   first saw the picture on Facebook - so I drove over to see it for
   myself on Sunday.

   "When I saw the white lines I nearly died."
   Image copyright Northern Ireland Tourist Board Image caption The
   intertwined beech branches and gnarled trunks make the Dark Hedges an
   iconic sight

   Amateur photographer Bob McCallion has been photographing the Dark
   Hedges for 20 years.

   He said the white lines were "sacrilege".

   "They've just considered the road to be more or less like any other
   road in the country," he said.

   Mr McCallion said while he was glad the lines were being removed, a
   wider strategy was needed to preserve the trees.

   "If you go there for the first time, you think they're still brilliant
   and they are. But if you have been following them [over time], you will
   see the deterioration in those trees," he said.

   "It's not Game of Thrones' fault, it's the lack of strategy or
   facilities to cope with those visitors.

   "There's a whole scenario that doesn't seem to improve year on year."

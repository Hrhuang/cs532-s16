   NBC Sports has released a promotional video to build up the momentum
   ahead of Sunday’s Premier League match between Arsenal and Leicester
   City.

   The Foxes take on the Gunners in a game that will be televised live
   across the United States on NBCSN beginning at 7am ET (pre-match
   coverage begins at 6am ET).

   NBC’s new promo video is entitled ‘Who’s Laughing Now?’

   After Sunday’s result, we’ll have a much clearer picture.

       It’s a shame for US fans that they moved the game to 7:00 AM Sunday
       from 10:00 AM Saturday. I would have much preferred the 10 AM time
       slot.

            Reminder:
            The TV rightsholders in Hong Kong (population less than 8
            million) and Singapore (population less than 5 million) both
            paid more money for EPL rights than the TV rightsholder in the
            U.S. (Comcast Corporation.)
            The BEST EPL matches on weekends prior Champions League
            matches will almost always be in an early time slot (Saturday
            1245 London Time, or Sunday either 1200, 1330, or 1405 London
            Time.) The EPL takes care of its Asian TV rightsholders and
            accomodate local police request to have “high risk” matches
            end before local sunset to aid crowd control.

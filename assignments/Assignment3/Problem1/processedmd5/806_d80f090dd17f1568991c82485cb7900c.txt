   CHICAGO (WLS) --
   Bulls guard/forward Jimmy Butler is expected to miss the next three to
   four weeks with a strained left knee, the team said in a statement
   Tuesday afternoon.
   Pau Gasol will replace Butler in the NBA All-Star Game this Sunday in
   Toronto, according to the Bulls.
   "Butler has begun rehabbing his injury and he will be allowed to engage
   in all activities as tolerated with the primary goal of maintaining his
   conditioning over the ensuing weeks," the statement said.
   He originally suffered the injury in the second quarter of Friday
   night's game at Denver.
   Butler was selected as a reserve to the East squad by the Eastern
   Conference head coaches.

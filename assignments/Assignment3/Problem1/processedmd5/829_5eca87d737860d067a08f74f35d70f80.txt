About this project

   Out of ConTXT puts the “social media” into “social party game”. It’s
   just like games you’ve played before (Apples to Apples™, Cards Against
   Humanity™), but different than any game you’ve played before. The best
   part is, it gets “more different” every time you play!

   Each round has you searching through text messages, photos, and even
   song titles on your phone to answer suggestions from the Out of ConTXT
   deck. Come up with the best/funniest answer and you are on your way to
   winning the game! Don’t be surprised if games don’t get finished
   because you want to know more about the text one of your friends just
   read out loud.

   This game was created, not by seasoned game crafters, but by comedians.
   It was literally born on stage by the improv comedy troupe, Quick Wits.
   But more on that later, let’s take a look at the game that took the
   Salt Lake City Comic Con by storm!

   Much laughing ensues before it’s time to vote on a winner. At OoC we go
   with the democratic approach. After everyone has given their answer
   it's time to vote. This is done by having everyone point at the person
   they think had the best answer (no voting for yourself, geez!). The
   person receiving the most votes gets the card and another round is
   started.

   Out of ConTXT has found a way to get rid of some of the negative
   factors of similar games. Things like; being tired of the same cards
   always coming up, all the cards in my hand are bad, and having to
   constantly buy new cards just to keep it “fresh”.

   With our game your phone is your “deck” and you're adding new “cards”
   every day. And think about this, everyone playing is holding a
   different deck. Best of all, everything in your “deck” is personal. You
   either put it there or someone sent it to you. Everything actually has
   personal relevance to you. This is one of most unique features of an
   already great game.

    Like we said, we’re not game makers, we’re laugh makers. Out of ConTXT
   was born over time during our live improv shows. Quick Wits likes to
   involve our audience a great deal and years ago we started taking
   people’s phones and forced actors to read the texts they found in
   phones instead of actual lines. This game quickly became one of our
   most popular games and everyone loved hearing the texts being taken
   “out of context”.

   One night during a Cards Against Humanity™ session it hit us that if we
   used the texts on our phones instead of the cards in our hands, we’d
   never run out of fresh answers. It was great! As much as we love CAH
   (several of us have all the cards, a piece of the island and are
   awaiting our coronation), it just wasn’t the same any more. We were
   hooked on this new game.

   Instantly we thought about getting this to Kickstarter, but we wanted
   to make sure that we had the right mix in our game first. We spent
   months play testing through Facebook, on stage, and at parties, then we
   put up  our own money to get some beta decks made and get a booth at
   Comic Con in Salt Lake City. In the three days we were there we sold
   almost everything we brought!
   Haley Pullos (General Hospital, Instant Mom, House, etc.) is spreading
   the love for Out of ConTXT! Haley Pullos (General Hospital, Instant
   Mom, House, etc.) is spreading the love for Out of ConTXT!

   Even better than selling the games were the stories we heard back from
   those that bought it. Stories of playing in a restaurant and having
   people at other tables pulling out their phones and playing along.
   Stories of games taking over the waiting lines for panels. Even stories
   of people missing their  stations because they were too involved in
   playing the game with a train car full of strangers.

   personal..." -- Facebook post by Taylor Lawrence

   You see, this was our dream. We think we’re quite good at making people
   laugh when they come to our show, but the idea of creating something
   that brought laughs even when we’re not around… that’s an amazing
   feeling.

   We’ve already mentioned that we put our own money into a beta version
   of the game and wanted to make sure it was worth selling. This was
   incredible for information gathering and play testing on a wide level.
   We now believe we have a game that could be the next big thing.

   We’re looking for help to bring our dream to the finish line. We want a
   game that looks as good as it plays. This means some design work on the
   packaging, getting the site where we want it, production of the games,
   and other bits that go into the mix.

   We thank you in advance and hope that you’ll find our rewards worth
   going after. As you can see, we've backed over 60 Kickstarter projects.
   We believe in this community and look forward to joining it from this
   side of things.

    We want you to know that we have a lot in store for Out Of ConTXT.
   You’ve probably noticed that we’ve already created two expansions for
   the game (“After Dark” and “Geek Deck”), but we’re not stopping there.
   We already have other decks lined up, with the currently-in-development
   election deck, "Raucous Caucus" taking on a life of it's own!

   As it stands now, the "Basic Deck" has 150 suggestion cards and each
   expansion adds another 100. While this number is subject to change,
   we'll always try to give as much bang for the buck as we can.

   Game Creation: Bob Bedore

   Game Design: Blake T. Heywood

   Development Team: Jason Wild, Shawn Zumbrunnen, Briana Bedore

   Technical Stuff: Jourdan Dixon

   Playtesters: Several Quick Wits audiences, much of the Salt Lake Comic
   Con and everyone we can get to play with us!

   Apples to Apples™ and Card Against Humanity™ are trademarked and very
   great games. We own everything they've ever put out and play the games
   A LOT! Our use of their name is just to give you an easy way to
   envision our game. If you weren't aware of these games, shame on you,
   go by them!

Risks and challenges

   Yes... there are risks. You see them in every Kickstarter. I've been
   burned on more than one. Please know that things can happen out of our
   control, but know that we will always keep you in the loop as to what
   is going on.

   And know that we've already put our own money into our "Beta Launch" at
   Comic Con. We did that to make sure that we had a game worth selling
   and to get an idea of the risks we might face.

   We want "Out of ConTXT" to succeed and will do everything we can to
   make it happen, and hopefully hurdle any challenges put in our path!

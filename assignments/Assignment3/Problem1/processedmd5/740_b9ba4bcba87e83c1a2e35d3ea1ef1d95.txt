   Nebraska senior forward Shavon Shields is resting comfortably and will
   continue to go through concussion protocol before he can return to the
   basketball court, according to the men’s basketball team’s head
   athletic trainer, R.J. Pietig.

   “He’s doing better,” Pietig said Monday night on the Nebraska
   Basketball Radio Show. “He’s at home, resting comfortably. He’s in the
   best hands in Lincoln right now, as his mother is staying with him.”

   The 6-foot-7, 220-pound Shields suffered a serious fall in Nebraska’s
   87-63 victory against Rutgers on Saturday in Lincoln that sent him to a
   hospital. Shields banged his head and neck on the court and was knocked
   unconscious.

   Shields regained consciousness after about a minute and had feeling and
   movement in his extremities as he was taken off the court. A CT scan
   was negative.

   Nebraska (13-11, 5-6 Big Ten Conference) plays at Wisconsin (14-9, 6-4)
   on Wednesday. Shields, who averages 15.7 points and five rebounds,
   second on the team in both categories, has made 106 consecutive starts.
   Dave Hoppen holds the school record for consecutive starts at 111, set
   from 1983-86.

   Dr. Lonnie Albers will evaluate Shields, who must remain symptom-free
   while completing a series of steps before he can return to action.

   Once initially free of concussion symptoms, Pietig said, Shields can
   begin low-impact cardiovascular work. If no symptoms still exist,
   Shields can then do individual drills and shooting, and then
   non-contact practice drills, and finally, full-contact.

   “We’ll look at things further (Tuesday) and decide what’s going to be
   the best thing for Shavon,” Pietig said. “If we feel he’s good to go,
   we’ll take things accordingly. If it’s something we’re not comfortable
   with, we’ll do what we feel is best.”

   Nebraska coach Tim Miles, via text message, had no other updates on
   Shields. Miles will next address the media late Tuesday afternoon,
   after practice and before the Huskers fly to Madison, Wisconsin.

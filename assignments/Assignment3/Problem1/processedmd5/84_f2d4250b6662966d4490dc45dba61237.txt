   What you’re looking at is an architectural rendering of TCF Bank
   Stadium for the upcoming outdoor game between the Minnesota Wild and
   Chicago Blackhawks on Sunday, Feb. 21.

   The current forecast for that day in Minneapolis is a high of 27° F and
   a low of 19° F, with only a 20 percent possibility of precipitation,
   i.e. snow.

   Which is to say, that guy in the Toews jersey is gonna be cold. At
   least roll up your sleeves, man. Don’t be a hero.

   The game, scheduled for 3:30 p.m. ET, will be broadcast live on NBC as
   part of Hockey Day in America, while Hockey Night In Canada and TVA
   Sports will have the action for the folks up north.

   Make as little or as much out of this as you’d like, but the bottom
   line is that John Torchetti is 1-0-0 as the Minnesota Wild’s interim
   head coach.

   The Wild looked hungry in this one, generating a 17-4 shot advantage in
   the first period and eventually beating the Vancouver Canucks 5-2.

   This ends a morbid eight-game losing streak for the Wild. It’s just the
   second win this Minnesota team managed since Jan. 10.

   [108]Zach Parise and [109]Ryan Suter have been fine this season, yet
   some will notice that they really stood up in this one. Parise scored a
   boisterous goal and generated five shots on net while Suter continues
   his strong offensive season, collecting two assists to push his total
   to 30 (and 37 points overall).

   Again, it’s easy to get lost in one victory and lose track of the big
   picture, especially with Vancouver struggling with issues of its own.

   The Wild will gladly, desperately take this win, and maybe the jump to
   the West playoff picture looks a little easier to manage after tonight.

   Maybe.

     Torchetti: "just a lot of fun. … It was all about them tonight."

   The Montreal Canadiens aren’t that far removed from their ultra-rare
   three-game winning streak. It just feels like it.

   They were absolutely embarrassed by the Arizona Coyotes on Monday
   night, dropping a 6-2 defeat. It’s the second straight loss in which
   they’ve allowed six goals (the Buffalo Sabres beat them 6-4 on Friday).

   These letdowns likely wash away most, if not all, of the good feelings
   from that fleeting run. The bigger picture doesn’t help their cause:

     Canadiens with a season low 19 Shots on Goal vs Arizona…now 7-17-1
     in last 25 games.

   It’s tough not to wonder if the Habs are tuning out Michel Therrien,
   even if GM Marc Bergevin gave him a vote of confidence fairly recently.
   At least one observer believes that Therrien deflected some blame:

     Coach's way of saying this is on the players, asking them all to
     stay in the room to answer questions. [125]https://t.co/amQeKHXKKF

     — Аrpon Basu (@ArponBasu) [126]February 16, 2016

   The Coyotes never really needed to worry about [127]Anders Lindback‘s
   off-the-ice injury, as [128]Louis Domingue was fine with his team in
   control. It may be a concern going forward, however.

     Dave Tippett on Anders Lindback's injury "It doesn’t look good.
     We’ll get more tests (Tuesday), but I think it’s a fairly serious
     injury."

     — Dave Vest (@davest4yotes) [129]February 16, 2016

   Some might cling to playoff hopes for the Canadiens, yet beyond the
   Therrien question, there’s a tough call to make perhaps even sooner:
   should the Habs be sellers at the trade deadline?

   The Dallas Stars are indeed [142]back on track, and that means looking
   like a locomotive once again.

   It was a closely fought game against the Nashville Predators, but
   Dallas came through with a 3-2 overtime win, thanks in large part to
   [143]Tyler Seguin fighting through pain to suit up.

   Naturally, No. 91 was a big contributor, doing a huge chunk of the work
   on [144]Mattias Janmark‘s OT game-winner:

   This gives the Stars four straight wins and maintains their tiebreaker
   advantage over the Chicago Blackhawks, who blew out the Toronto Maple
   Leafs.

     Stars: 37-15-5 (79 points)
     4 straight wins overall
     5 straight wins on the road

   The Chicago Blackhawks are already an unfair matchup for the Toronto
   Maple Leafs without Chicago’s netminder making amazing saves.

   [159]Patrick Kane is on a tear on Monday night, but [160]Scott Darling
   stole some of the spotlight with his fantastic glove save, which you
   can watch in the video above.

   As of this writing, the Blackhawks are blowing out the Maple Leafs 7-1.

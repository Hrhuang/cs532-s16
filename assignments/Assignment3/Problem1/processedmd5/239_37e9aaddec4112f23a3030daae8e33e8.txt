Moderate level puzzle game


   by Simone's Mama

   I was looking for a puzzle game and am mildly pleased. I like the idea
   of the game but it wasn't very difficult. I like that you have to go
   back and forth to find clues and solve things. But the prison is the
   hardest level only because it's so big. Wish all the levels were like
   that. My biggest complaint is that I had to tap numerous times to find
   a specific area or to open something. I feel the touch response could
   be better. I used 2 hints only because I didn't place the cheese in the
   exact spot and because the grate wouldn't open. Other than that I
   enjoyed the 1 1/2 hrs I spent playing this.

An Okay Game


   by EmmA Cao ‚ù§Ô∏èüíõüíöüíôüíú

   This is honestly okay. Sure, I kind of got seasick or carsick or
   whatever you call it with all the swaying and stuff (though I was
   pretty surprised, since I played The Room like, ten times and I didn't
   feel sick once), but the puzzles were all right. I had a hard time
   getting used to how to go up, down, etc., because everything is
   backwards from The Room. For example, in The Room, you swipe up to go
   down. In this game, it's all the complete opposite.

Brain-less tap tap üëéüèº


   by iTuneStar10

   Who would think you need flame to open a ribbon on a box that contains
   a knife?! And you get the flame by lighting an oven with a gas lighter!
   Somehow the flame of the gas lighter will not do. A brilliant plan!
   With a can opener you open a tin can to find a battery! Must be common
   where this guy comes from. Then you put that battery into a wind-up
   wall clock! Maybe it's a hybrid clock? The list goes on.
   Imagination failure!

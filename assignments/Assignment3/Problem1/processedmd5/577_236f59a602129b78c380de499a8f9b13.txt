   “Based on recent allegations against Denver Bronco’s Quarterback Peyton
   Manning, do you believe it is unethical for athletes to use performance
   enhancers to help return from injury?”


   Rob Trites Headshot Rob Trites (Sports Editor): Last year Steven
   Stamkos of the Tampa Bay Lightning, recovered from a broken
   tibia/fibula in just under two months. In my opinion he clearly used
   enhancers to recover, as it would normally take much longer to fully
   recover from that type of injury. Stars like Stamkos, being out of the
   game for long periods of time only hurts the game. If athletes can use
   enhancers to safely return to the game more quickly but stop when they
   are back, I have no problem with it.


   Tyler Belyea Tyler Belyea (Former Mediocre Athlete): First off, I want
   to put it out there that I am a Peyton Manning fan. Second, I’ll go out
   on a limb and say that Peyton will come up clean. Third, I might be of
   the unpopular opinion and do not believe it is unethical. We as fans
   want the best player on the field to watch, and they’re bound to need
   some help coming back from gruesome injuries. More importantly, go
   Broncos!



   John Robb John Robb (V-Reds Fan): I think everything in the NFL is
   unethical. On this specific issue, HGH wasn’t tested for when Peyton
   allegedly used it, so to test him now seems farcical at best. There
   were tests in 2013 that could have found HGH, but the NFL didn’t use
   them. In a league where your career can be over in one play and a team
   can cut you at any time, I won’t hold it against players attempting any
   treatment to get back to playing shape.


   Nathan Delong Headshot Nathan DeLong (Staff Reporter): It isn’t right
   to use performance-enhancing drugs to recover faster from injuries,
   which Peyton Manning denies while Shawn Horcoff of the NHL’s Anaheim
   Ducks admitted to doing it upon receiving a 20-game suspension. It’s
   also unethical to use substances to gain an edge (pun intended) over
   opponents instead of playing fair. But I can understand the temptation
   when on the mend, considering the physical toll of sports and potential
   salary implications for lost playing time.

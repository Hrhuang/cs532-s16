Sewickley-area teams have high hopes for boys basketball playoffs

   Three area boys teams are in the WPIAL basketball playoffs, and all
   three are contenders to be gearing up for the PIAA tournament in two
   weeks.

   Quaker Valley enters the Class AA tournament ranked No. 4 in the final
   Tribune-Review rankings, and Eden Christian and Sewickley Academy —
   ranked Nos. 2 and 3 in Class A — could be on a collision course for a
   rubber match when the WPIAL tournaments begin play Friday.

   The playoff pairings were announced Tuesday night, after this edition's
   deadline, but all three teams projected to be among the top seeds.

   Sewickley Academy (20-2) wrapped up its regular season Saturday with a
   66-51 win over Class AAA Hollidaysburg in the Hoops for a Cure event at
   North Allegheny. Chris Groetsch scored 22 points for the Panthers, who
   pulled away after entering the fourth quarter tied 42-42.

   “We knew nothing about (Hollidaysburg) prior to seeing them on the
   floor. They were physically strong, they hit six 3s in the first half
   and have an inside player who really dominated the first half,”
   Panthers coach Win Palmer said.

   “It was set up like a playoff game, in a big gym with no clear crowd
   rooting for one team or the other, and we had to adjust on the run. I
   was proud of the way our guys made adjustments. Hollidaysburg is as
   good of a team as we've beaten all year.”

   Adjusting has been a big focus for the Panthers since their
   late-December loss to state No. 1 Kennedy Catholic. Sewickley Academy
   largely has been successful employing an up-tempo style, but Palmer has
   been teaching his team how to steady the pace when needed because of
   matchups and game situations.

   “After playing Kennedy and seeing Farrell and Monessen, we learned we
   can't outrun and outscore teams like that,” Palmer said. “Our goal is
   to try to win a championship. You have to take into account other
   teams' styles, and midway through the year, we started learning how to
   play slow because that's the kind of game you get in the playoffs.”

   Palmer mentioned WPIAL No. 1 Monessen by name and said the Greyhounds
   are the favorite.

   Five other teams won section titles in Class A — Jeannette and Clairton
   shared a title, as did Sewickley and Eden — and Palmer said any of
   those six could reach the final. Because of that, he said he's not
   concerned whether his team is seeded second, sixth or in between.

   “In my mind, six teams can win it all, and probably 10 or 11 can get to
   the semifinals (and state tournament),” Palmer said.

   “It should be a fascinating tournament because there are so many good
   teams with different styles.”

   Eden Christian (19-3) wrapped up its regular season Monday with a 67-59
   win over Vincentian Academy as the Warriors showed they're ready to put
   their defensive mindset against up-tempo opposition like the Royals.
   Blake Carpenter led all scorers with 26 points for Eden, which has won
   11 straight since a Jan. 2 loss to Quaker Valley.

   As for the Quakers (18-4), their regular season ended Monday with a
   64-58 loss at Class AAA Central Valley despite 17 points apiece from
   Coletrane Washington and Amos Luptak.

   The loss shouldn't affect Quaker Valley's seeding in the Class AA
   tournament, where coach Mike Mastroianni said his team and its fellow
   Section 5-AA qualifiers should make some noise.

   Top-ranked Aliquippa, QV and No. 5 OLSH — the third-place team — are
   likely to avoid a preliminary-round game. Ten of the 21 teams in the
   bracket, possibly including a strong fourth-place Avonworth team that
   split the season series with the Quakers, will not be as fortunate.

   “We've been tested in our section, playing against Aliquippa and OLSH
   and Avonworth,” Mastroianni said last week. “I think all of those teams
   can win a couple games in the playoffs.”

TribLive commenting policy

   You are solely responsible for your comments and by using TribLive.com
   you agree to our [134]Terms of Service.

   We moderate comments. Our goal is to provide substantive commentary for
   a general readership. By screening submissions, we provide a space
   where readers can share intelligent and informed commentary that
   enhances the quality of our news and information.

   While most comments will be posted if they are on-topic and not
   abusive, moderating decisions are subjective. We will make them as
   carefully and consistently as we can. Because of the volume of reader
   comments, we cannot review individual moderation decisions with
   readers.

   We value thoughtful comments representing a range of views that make
   their point quickly and politely. We make an effort to protect
   discussions from repeated comments â either by the same reader or
   different readers.

   We follow the same standards for taste as the daily newspaper. A few
   things we won't tolerate: personal attacks, obscenity, vulgarity,
   profanity (including expletives and letters followed by dashes),
   commercial promotion, impersonations, incoherence, proselytizing and
   SHOUTING. Don't include URLs to Web sites.

   We do not edit comments. They are either approved or deleted. We
   reserve the right to edit a comment that is quoted or excerpted in an
   article. In this case, we may fix spelling and punctuation.

   We welcome strong opinions and criticism of our work, but we don't want
   comments to become bogged down with discussions of our policies and we
   will moderate accordingly.

   We appreciate it when readers and people quoted in articles or blog
   posts point out errors of fact or emphasis and will investigate all
   assertions. But these suggestions should be sent [135]via e-mail. To
   avoid distracting other readers, we won't publish comments that suggest
   a correction. Instead, corrections will be made in a blog post or in an
   article.

Newton defends actions at Super Bowl

   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) Cam Newton isn't apologizing for acting like a
   "sore loser" after the Super Bowl.

   The league's MVP has been widely criticized for walking out of a
   three-minute press conference after a 24-10 loss to the Denver Broncos
   on Sunday in which he answered questions with mostly one- and two-word
   responses while sulking in his chair wearing a black Carolina Panthers
   hoodie over his head.

   "Show me a good loser and I'll show you a loser," Newton said Tuesday
   as players cleaned out their lockers at the team's downtown stadium.

   Newton said he believes the situation is being overblown by the media,
   and added he doesn't plan to change how he reacts to losing just to
   appease his critics.

   "If I offended anybody that's cool, but I know who I am and I'm not
   about to conform nor bend for anybody's expectations because yours or
   anybody's expectations would never exceed mine," Newton said.

   The quarterback went on to say, "Who are you to say that your way is
   right? I have all of these people who are condemning and saying this,
   that and the third, but what makes your way right?"

   At one point during Newton's nearly seven-minute interview, his
   teammates walked behind the media gathered three-deep around his locker
   and starting saying, "We love you, Cam," and even sang him a song
   lightning the mood.

   Newton said his emotions were raw after the game and he simply didn't
   want to talk to the media.

   "When you invest so much time and sacrifice so much and things don't go
   as planned, I think emotions take over," Newton said. "I think that is
   what happens."

   Panthers coach Ron Rivera said while he prefers his fifth-year
   quarterback would have handled the situation a little better, he
   understands where he is coming from and what he felt at the time.

   "That's who he is. He hates to lose, that's the bottom line," Rivera
   said. "That is what you love in him. I would much rather have a guy who
   hates to lose than a guy who accepts it. The guy who accepts it, you
   might as well just push him out of your locker room because you don't
   want him around.

   "That is a beauty of a guy like that he wants to win and his teammates
   know it. That is what it is about. We don't play this game for a
   participation trophy. We want to win."

   Newton takes losing harder than most.

   In some past Carolina defeats, he's sat distraught at his locker still
   in his uniform for more than 30 minutes after the conclusion of the
   game. There are times it has taken him more than an hour before
   addressing the media.

   Because this was the Super Bowl, Newton was forced into the interview
   room a little sooner than normal.

   At one point, his attention appeared to drift to listening to Broncos
   players who were celebrating and talking about their win on the other
   side of the interview room.

   Rivera suggested in the future Newton may need more time before
   addressing the media to get his emotions in check.

   "There are a lot of young people out there looking at who we are, and
   we are role models for them," Rivera said. "I think again we know who
   he is and he does take it hard. Quite honestly if he is going to take
   it hard, as a public service, we should avoid having him talk right
   away. People take losses, not just football losses, but personal losses
   different ways. Time is probably the best thing."

   Teammates rallied behind Newton on Tuesday.

   They said they know how badly he wanted to win and how hard he takes
   losing games.

   "He's a competitor just like everybody else," fullback Mike Tolbert
   said. "He's not happy at all about what happened. I'm not happy about
   what happened. I think everyone on our team is not happy, so why should
   we be all smiles after? I can't expect anybody to be laughing and
   joking and ecstatic about losing a football game."

   Panthers general manager Dave Gettleman refused to criticize his
   franchise quarterback for the way he acted after the game.

   "I want players that hate to lose," Gettleman said. "I want players
   that I know when the game is over they are crawling into the locker
   room and they need help getting their gear off and they are going to
   need time getting into the shower. I want the buses to be late to the
   airport if we're traveling. We all handle defeat differently."

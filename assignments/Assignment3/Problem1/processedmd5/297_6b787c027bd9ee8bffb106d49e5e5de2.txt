   There are a number of reasons that you may have received this message.
   The most common is that the merchant who was advertising is temporarily
   not-actively promoting that program. If, however, you feel you have

   Shareasale.com manages the relationships between advertisers and
   affiliates, which is why you were directed to our site. Since the link
   that you clicked is not currently active, you were not redirected to
   the site.
   If you are a new affiliate, your links will not be active until
   Shareasale.com gets a chance to review your account - you will receive
   an email when your account is approved and links are activated. This
   process generally takes around 24 business hours.

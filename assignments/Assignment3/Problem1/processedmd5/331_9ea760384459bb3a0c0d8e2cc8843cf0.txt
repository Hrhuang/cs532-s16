   “Love begins at home, and it is not how much we do… but how much love
   we put in that action. – Mother Teresa”
   Everyone has one dream no matter how big or small is that but owning a
   house is a dream for all and as it is rightly quoted by Mother teresa
   Love Begins at home but owning a house is ok but making it secure is
   also important at the same time that where the homeowners insurance
   or home insurance comes handy.

   What homeowners insurance really means ?

     Homeowners insurance provides financial protection against
     disasters. A standard policy insures the home itself and the things
     you keep in it.

     Homeowners insurance is a package policy. This means that it covers
     both damage to your property and your liability or legal
     responsibility for any injuries and property damage you or members
     of your family cause to other people. This includes damage caused by
     household pets.

     Damage caused by most disasters is covered but there are exceptions.
     The most significant are damage caused by floods, earthquakes and
     poor maintenance. You must buy two separate policies for flood and
     earthquake coverage. Maintenance-related problems are the
     homeowners’ responsibility.

     Home insurance, also commonly called hazard insurance or homeowner’s
     insurance (often abbreviated in the US real estate industry as HOI),
     is a type of property insurance that covers a private residence. It
     is an insurance policy that combines various personal insurance
     protections, which can include losses occurring to one’s home, its
     contents, loss of use (additional living expenses), or loss of other
     personal possessions of the homeowner, as well as liability
     insurance for accidents that may happen at the home or at the hands
     of the homeowner within the policy territory.

   Benefits of Having homeowners insurance

   Asset Protection:-
   The core benefit of life insurance is that the financial interests of
   one’s family remain protected from circumstances such as loss of income
   due to critical illness or death of the policyholder. Simultaneously,
   insurance products also have a strong inbuilt wealth creation
   proposition. The customer therefore benefits on two counts and life
   insurance occupies a unique space in the landscape of investment
   options available to a customer.

   [23]secure

   Goal based savings:-
   Each of us has some goals in life for which we need to save. For a
   young, newly married couple, it could be buying a house. Once, they
   decide to start a family, the goal changes to planning for the
   education or marriage of their children. As one grows older, planning
   for one’s retirement will begin to take precedence.

   Clearly, as your life stage and therefore your financial goals change,
   the instrument in which you invest should offer corresponding benefits
   pertinent to the new life stage.

[25]Why and How to choose individual dental insurance

   July 27, 2015   [26]Dental insurance   [27]2 Comments

   In the earlier blog post we learn what insurance means what are the
   benefits of having insurance related to health insurance health care as
   going to dentist can prove costly sometime so we will know what is the
   best cheap health insurance and affordable life insurance , cheap car
   insurance ,health insurance , auto insurance , auto insurance quotes
   and many more to follow soon

   in this we will be covering why one should choose dental insurance is
   it necessary or its not that important

   so lets understand it

   What is Dental Insurance

     Dental insurance is designed to pay a portion of the costs
     associated with dental care. There are several different types of
     individual, family, or group dental insurance plans grouped into
     three primary categories: (1) Indemnity (generally called: dental
     insurance) that allows you to see any dentist you want who accepts
     this type of coverage; (2) Preferred Provide Network dental plans
     (PPO); and (3) Dental Health Managed Organizations (DHMO) in which
     you are assigned or select an in-network dentist and/or in-network
     dental office and use the dental benefits in that network.

     Generally dental offices have a fee schedule, or a list of prices
     for the dental services or procedures they offer. Dental insurance
     companies have similar fee schedules which is generally based on
     Usual and Customary dental services, an average of fees in your
     area. The fee schedule is commonly used as the transactional
     instrument between the insurance company, dental office and/or
     dentist, and the consumer.

   [28]den

   Understanding types of Dental insurance

   Indemnity Dental Insurance Plan

     Indemnity Dental Insurance Plan: This plan may be helpful when you
     want to stay with your dentist and he/she does not participate in a
     dental network. By the very nature of this plan the insurance
     company generally pays the dentist a percentage of your services
     according to the policy you purchased. In addition you will want to
     review the co-payment requirements, waiting periods, stated
     deductible, annual limitations, graduated percentage scales based on
     the type of procedure and/or length of time you have owned the
     policy prior to starting your dental work.

   [29]den c

   Participating Provider Network (PPO)

     Participating Provider Network (PPO). Depending on your specific
     plan, the PPO works similar to a DHMO while using an In-Network
     facility. However, it allows you to use an Out-of-Network or
     Non-Participating Provider. Any difference of fees will become the
     financial responsibility of the patient unless otherwise specified
     in your dental policy. As noted, some dental insurance plans may
     have an annual maximum benefit limit. Thus, once the annual maximum
     benefit is exhausted any additional treatments may become the
     patient’s responsibility. Each year that annual maximum is reissued.
     The reissued date may vary as a calendar year, company fiscal year,
     or date of enrollment based on your specific plan.

   Dental Health Maintenance Organization (DHMO)

     Dental Health Maintenance Organization (DHMO): When a dentist signs
     a contract with a dental insurance company that provider agrees to
     accept an insurance fee schedule and give their customers a reduced
     cost for services as an In-Network Provider. Many DHMO insurance
     plans have little or no waiting periods, no annual maximum benefit
     limitations, while covering major dental work near the start of the
     policy period. This plan is sometimes purchased to help defray the
     high cost of the dental procedures. Some dental insurance plans
     offer free semi-annual preventative treatment. Fillings, crowns,
     implants and dentures may have various limitations.

[31]How does travel insurance work – [ Understand it Better ]

   July 26, 2015   [32]Travel insurance   [33]No comments

   Travel help us to understand us more better by being ourself

   As Most people live life caught up in a routine, and this can make it
   difficult to find time for reflection.

   As an individual dedicated to becoming the best version of myself, it’s
   essential for me to step back to look at myself so that I can evaluate
   my strengths and weaknesses.

   Although it’s not the only answer, (or the cheapest) again, travel can
   help.

   so How does travel insurance work you must be wondering about it lets
   understand it better with ‘[34]insurancecent‘

     Basically, using insurance begins as you encounter any problem after
     you’ve purchased coverage and before or during a trip.. a problem
     that puts your plans at risk and/or that threatens considerable cost
     beyond what you would normally encounter. (This won’t include
     coverage for essential steps on your trip that you failed to arrange
     for yourself, e.g., lodging, meals, fully adequate connection times
     between flights.)

     Once you know the details of the problem (and any cost), you
     promptly contact the claims people for the company that issued your
     policy. You explain the situation, and they instruct you on what to
     do for a covered problem.
     * For problems with modest cost that are covered, you’ll likely be
       told to pay the costs (preferably by credit card), keep all
       supporting bills/invoices/receipts, and to file a claim with the
       company after your trip is over.
     * For problems with great cost (e.g., overseas medical evacuation can
       cost a fortune), the insurer may do the same…though such costs can
       easily exceed the maximum “draw” allowed on your charge card.
       Better travel insurance also have “preferred providers” in numerous
       countries, one of which may be able to help you at lesser cost than
       others…or even provide the service you need and directly bill the
       insurer.
     * If you do not have the means to pay for what you need (and then
       wait for reimbursement), and no preferred provider can be used,
       some insurers will transfer funds to help. They do so only after
       being satisfied about costs encountered, and that they are sending
       the funds to and for someone who is covered.

     [35]trav

     See “Making a claim” below for more discussion.

     To wisely purchase coverage, carefully read the policy before buying
     to assure it provides coverage you need…per the discussions below.

     To be able to use your policy and procedures effectively, print
     copies and take two or more in separate bags. In addition, take
     copies of the instructions on how to contact the insurer’s claims
     section…at least in two separate bags.

   So what are you waiting for the Sky is the Limit so enjoy the life at
   its best with travel insurance :)

[43]Understanding auto insurance from the start

   July 24, 2015   [44]Auto Insurance   [45]No comments

   After health i think we all love our vehicle and almost every
   individual has its own vehicle for its personal use but what if you
   have a sudden accident and you vehicle get distorted and you get heavy
   bills to get it repair i hope you got my point here

   this is where auto insurance came to rescue and save us from those
   heavy expenditures

   so what is auto insurance ??

     Vehicle insurance (also known as, GAP insurance, car insurance, or
     motor insurance) is insurance purchased for cars, trucks,
     motorcycles, and other road vehicles. Its primary use is to provide
     financial protection against physical damage and/or bodily injury
     resulting from traffic collisions and against liability that could
     also arise there from the specific terms of vehicle insurance vary
     with legal regulations in each region. To a lesser degree vehicle
     insurance may additionally offer financial protection against theft
     of the vehicle and possibly damage to the vehicle, sustained from
     things other than traffic collisions you can get some very cheap
     auto insurance at a great price which can came handy later

   Benifits of Having auto insurance

     Your auto insurance policy includes more than just coverage for your
     vehicle. It also includes some added benefits (some that are
     standard, some you can add) that can help make your insurance
     experience as hassle-free as possible.

     Accident Forgiveness: If you’ve been accident and violation-free for
     5 years (no matter what insurance carrier you’ve been with), we
     won’t raise your rates due to your first accident. If you qualify,
     you’ll receive this benefit at no extra cost.

     Lifetime Repair Guarantee: If your car is in an accident covered
     under your policy, you can have it fixed at one of our approved
     repair shops and the repairs will be guaranteed for as long as you
     own your vehicle.

     Roadside Assistance: If your vehicle ever breaks down, we won’t
     leave you stranded. From a jump-start to a tow, our optional 24-Hour
     Roadside Assistance coverage will get you moving again – we’ll even
     make the arrangements.1

     12-Month Rate Guarantee: Many auto insurance policies only last
     6-months. This means that your rate can change after only half a
     year. At Liberty Mutual, our policies are for a full-year –
     guaranteeing your rate for an entire year.

     Convenient Payment Options: Paying your bill should be quick and
     easy; whether over the phone, online or through our mobile app,
     there are a number of options at your disposal. Have your payments
     deducted automatically from your checking or savings account
     (Electronic Funds Transfer), pay by credit card, mail us a check –
     you decide.2

     After-Hours Policy Services: Have a policy or billing question, or
     need to change your policy? You can call our customer service
     representatives for expert help with questions regarding your policy
     and billing after normal business hours and on weekends.

   Aim of the obamacare

     President Obama may have signed the Affordable Care Act into law,
     but the truth is obamacare is the result of decades of ideas from
     both sides of the isle and the health care industry. The idea of an
     individual mandate was first presented by current opponents of the
     law the Heritage Foundation in 1989. obamacareitself was in fact
     modeled after “Romney Care”, which is the nickname for the health
     care reform law implemented in the State of Massachusetts by then
     Governor Mitt Romney.

   So

     What does health insurance means ??

   Health insurance is insurance against the risk of incurring medical
   expenses among individuals. By estimating the overall risk of health
   care and health system expenses, among a targeted group, an insurer can
   develop a routine finance structure, such as a monthly premium or
   payroll tax, to ensure that money is available to pay for the health
   care benefits specified in the insurance agreement. The benefit is
   administered by a central organization such as a government agency,
   private business, or not-for-profit entity. According to the Health
   Insurance Association of America, health insurance is defined as
   “coverage that provides for the payments of benefits as a result of
   sickness or injury. Includes insurance for losses from accident,
   medical expense, disability, or accidental death and dismemberment

   [63]16f29692-513b-4aae-b15d-8184d5c917de1

   Do I Really Need Health Insurance ??

   Many people think of health insurance as something you use when you’re
   sick, but it’s much more than that. You can take advantage of the
   preventive services your plan offers. By visiting your doctor regularly
   for check-ups and getting your recommended screenings, you’re more
   likely to prevent more serious conditions later on. Plus, many health
   plans offer wellness programs and discounts on health products and
   services.

     term insurance plans or term policy is life insurance that provided

     limited period of time, the relevant term. After that period
     expires, coverage at the previous rate of premiums is no longer
     guaranteed and the client must either forgo coverage or potentially
     obtain further coverage with different payments or conditions. If
     the life insured dies during the term, the death benefit will be
     paid to the beneficiary. Term insurance is the least expensive way
     to purchase a substantial death benefit on a coverage amount per
     premium dollar basis over a specific period of time.

     in force for the insured’s entire lifetime, provided required
     premiums are paid, or to the maturity date.Premiums are fixed, based

     you pay premiums until death, except for limited pay policies, which

     called “straight life,” or “ordinary life.” Whole life insurance
     belongs to the cash value category of life insurance, which also

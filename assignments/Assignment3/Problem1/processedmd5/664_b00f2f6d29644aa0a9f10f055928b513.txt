   Carolina Panthers QB Cam Newton has led his 14-1 team to Superbowl 50
   to face Peyton Manning and their red hot defense two days ago. I
   watched that whole game as everyone else did and seen Cam "Superman"
   Newton couldn't seem to get a rhythm going, though at times Carolina
   did something good things, it wasn't enough to stop Denver's defense
   who played like they studied Cam from his college years, all the games
   he played in the NFL leading up to Superbowl 50. The Broncos sacked Cam
   7 times in that game making it the most the "Dab King" has been on his
   back all season long.

   End result was a Carolina loss to Denver 24-10 in which it was tough on
   fans who supported the Panthers all season long. Some celebrities made
   crazy wagers and lost a lot of money behind their loss. Cam was
   interviewed shortly after the game filled with frustrations and
   emotions, he answered a few questions, then stormed out leaving the
   press hanging with unanswered questions which caused mix reactions from
   fans and critics alike. Racism even became an issue from a former NFL
   player referring to Cam Newton as "Boy".

   Though a lot of people said Cam shouldn't have handled that press
   conference like that, he still feels unapologetic and remains firm on
   not being what the world wants him to be. Here's a little bit of what
   he had to say. Click the image below to see the full interview.

     I ain't got no more tears to cry, obviously I had a lot of time to
     think about it and I've seen so much blown out of proportion At the
     end of the day when you invest so much time and you sacrifice so
     much and things don't go as planed I think emotions take over. As
     far as trying to be like this person or that person, I heard
     numerous quotes about "what if this person was in that situation"
     how would he would've handle it? Well we've seen this person do
     that, how would he would've handled it?

     The truth of the matter is I'm not trying to be this person or that
     person. I said it since day one I am who I am, I know what I'm
     capable of and I know where I'm going. And I don't have to conform
     to anybodies else's wants for me to do "I'm not that guy" If you
     want me to be this type of person I'm not that and I'm happy to say
     that. This league is a great league with or without me and I take
     pride in that and that's pretty much how I feel

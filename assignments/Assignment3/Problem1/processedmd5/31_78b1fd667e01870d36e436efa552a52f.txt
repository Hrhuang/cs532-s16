   [97]Local man and his son draw out for prestigious ODWC elk hunt

     * Posted on Feb 9, 2016
       by [99]Jared Porter
       The most coveted hunt to obtain through the Oklahoma Department of
       Wildlife Conservation’s controlled hunts program is undoubtedly the
       once-in-a-lifetime elk hunt in the Wichita Mountains Wildlife
       Refuge.
       The chance of being drawn for this hunt is minute. This year, over
       35,000 hunters applied for the 180 available elk tags, leaving each
       applicant with a 0.005 percent chance of acquiring a tag.
       Tahlequah native Blake Stephens, age 54, was one of the hunters
       whose name was drawn.
       Blake, a lifelong outdoorsman who has experience harvesting a wide
       range of different game, had entered his name in the lottery-type
       elk hunt drawing for 29 years before finally being selected. And
       much to his surprise, his son, 29-year-old Joshua Stephens, was
       also drawn for this year’s prestigious elk hunt after applying for
       the past 11 years.
       “We were elated about being drawn out,” Blake said. “My son,
       Joshua, called me and said he had been selected for the elk hunt,
       and I thought he was pulling my leg. It just sounded too good to be
       true for one of us to be that fortunate.”
       Turns out, Joshua and Blake were the fortunate ones. After his
       phone conversation with his son, Blake checked the ODWC website and
       found that he, too, had been drawn for the hunt.
       “I immediately called Joshua back and told him the good news,”
       Blake said. “We were really fired up and excited. The odds of one
       person drawing out for a hunt in their lifetime is small enough,
       but for a man and his son to draw out in the same year, that’s
       basically like winning the lottery.”
       As advertised, the Wichita Mountains elk hunt is truly a
       once-in-a-lifetime event. Once a hunter draws out, he or she will
       never be eligible for the hunt again. That is true whether the
       hunter harvests an elk, does not harvest an elk or is unable to
       make the trip.
       “You know that you’ll never get to do it again,” Blake said. “About
       seven or 10 years ago was when they made it a lifetime hunt. So, up
       until then, if you drew out, you could put your name into the
       drawing again. But that’s not the case anymore.”
       Hunters who are lucky enough to be drawn also get to see parts of
       the Wichita Mountains refuge not open to the public. Unlike most
       whitetail deer hunting where you sit in a stand and wait, in the
       estimated 5,000-acre designated hunting area in the Wichitas, you
       have to spot and stalk the elk.
       This year’s bunch of selected hunters were divided into two
       separate groups for a 2.5-day hunt in December and a 2.5-day hunt
       in January. Blake was slotted for the December hunt, while Joshua
       was scheduled for January.
       Each hunter was allowed to being a helper to help skin, quarter and
       pack the harvested elk. Joshua and Blake chose each other to be
       their appointed helpers, giving them an opportunity to experience
       the prestigious event twice over the course of a little more than
       one month.
       Blake noted that while the Wichita Mountains features a beautiful
       and scenic landscape, the rough terrain can be physically taxing.
       “You’re walking around on mountainous, rough terrain stalking elk
       all day and it gets tiring, so it makes sense to have a helper with
       you to help harvest your elk,” Blake said. “It was pretty neat to
       have Joshua with me for my hunt and for me to help him out on his.”
       Both Blake and Joshua harvested their elk on the first day of their
       respective hunts, and coincidentally, both of them acquired their
       bulls at the same time of 4:10 p.m. Blake’s bull (harvested on
       December 8) measured out at 6-by-6 and field dressed at 476 pounds,
       while Joshua also acquired a 6-by-6 bull (harvested on January 12).
       “The 29-year anticipation of what my hunt would someday be is now a
       memory,” Blake said. “I felt blessed to be able to share my
       experience with my son. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the
       Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation partner in making this
       one of the best hunts in the country. The staff goes above and
       beyond to make sure the hunters enjoy their lifetime hunt.”
       The elk herd in the Wichita Mountains refuge is estimated to be
       around 1,000 before the hunts. Rod Smith, the Southwest Region
       Supervisor for the refuge, reported that 63 bulls and cows were
       harvested in the December hunt this year, leaving a 90 percent
       success rate for bull hunters and a 75 percent success rate for cow
       hunters. In the January hunt, there were 62 bulls and cows
       harvested. The overall success rate was 81 percent for both hunts.

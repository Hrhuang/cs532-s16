<p><strong>&#8220;Love begins at home, and it is not how much we do&#8230; but how much love we put in that action. &#8211; Mother Teresa&#8221;</strong><br />
Everyone has one dream no matter how big or small is that but owning a house is a dream for all and as it is rightly quoted by Mother teresa Love Begins at home but owning a house is ok but making it secure is also important at the same time that where the homeowners insurance or home insurance comes handy.</p>
<p>What homeowners insurance really means ?</p>
<blockquote><p>Homeowners insurance provides financial protection against disasters. A standard policy insures the home itself and the things you keep in it.</p>
<p>Homeowners insurance is a package policy. This means that it covers both damage to your property and your liability or legal responsibility for any injuries and property damage you or members of your family cause to other people. This includes damage caused by household pets.</p>
<p>Damage caused by most disasters is covered but there are exceptions. The most significant are damage caused by floods, earthquakes and poor maintenance. You must buy two separate policies for flood and earthquake coverage. Maintenance-related problems are the homeowners&#8217; responsibility.</p>
<p>Home insurance, also commonly called hazard insurance or homeowner&#8217;s insurance (often abbreviated in the US real estate industry as HOI), is a type of property insurance that covers a private residence. It is an insurance policy that combines various personal insurance protections, which can include losses occurring to one&#8217;s home, its contents, loss of use (additional living expenses), or loss of other personal possessions of the homeowner, as well as liability insurance for accidents that may happen at the home or at the hands of the homeowner within the policy territory.</p>
<p><a href="https://insurancecent.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/sav.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-77 aligncenter" src="https://insurancecent.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/sav.jpg?w=300" alt="Hands holding a piggy bank and a house model" width="300" height="201" /></a></p></blockquote>
<p>Benefits of Having homeowners insurance</p>
<p><strong>Asset Protection:-</strong><br />
The core benefit of life insurance is that the financial interests of one’s family remain protected from circumstances such as loss of income due to critical illness or death of the policyholder. Simultaneously, insurance products also have a strong inbuilt wealth creation proposition. The customer therefore benefits on two counts and life insurance occupies a unique space in the landscape of investment options available to a customer.</p>
<p><a href="https://insurancecent.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/secure.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-78 aligncenter" src="https://insurancecent.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/secure.jpg?w=300" alt="secure" width="300" height="196" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Goal based savings:-</strong><br />
Each of us has some goals in life for which we need to save. For a young, newly married couple, it could be buying a house. Once, they decide to start a family, the goal changes to planning for the education or marriage of their children. As one grows older, planning for one&#8217;s retirement will begin to take precedence.</p>
<p>Clearly, as your life stage and therefore your financial goals change, the instrument in which you invest should offer corresponding benefits pertinent to the new life stage.</p>

<p>In the earlier blog post we learn what insurance means what are the benefits of having insurance related to health insurance health care as going to dentist can prove costly sometime so we will know what is the best cheap health insurance and affordable life insurance , cheap car insurance ,health insurance , auto insurance , auto insurance quotes and many more to follow soon</p>
<p>in this we will be covering why one should choose dental insurance is it necessary or its not that important</p>
<p>so lets understand it</p>
<p>What is Dental Insurance</p>
<blockquote><p>Dental insurance is designed to pay a portion of the costs associated with dental care. There are several different types of individual, family, or group dental insurance plans grouped into three primary categories: (1) Indemnity (generally called: dental insurance) that allows you to see any dentist you want who accepts this type of coverage; (2) Preferred Provide Network dental plans (PPO); and (3) Dental Health Managed Organizations (DHMO) in which you are assigned or select an in-network dentist and/or in-network dental office and use the dental benefits in that network.</p>
<p>Generally dental offices have a fee schedule, or a list of prices for the dental services or procedures they offer. Dental insurance companies have similar fee schedules which is generally based on Usual and Customary dental services, an average of fees in your area. The fee schedule is commonly used as the transactional instrument between the insurance company, dental office and/or dentist, and the consumer.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://insurancecent.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/den.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-68 aligncenter" src="https://insurancecent.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/den.jpg?w=300" alt="den" width="300" height="187" /></a></p>
<p>Understanding types of Dental insurance</p>
<p><b>Indemnity Dental Insurance Plan</b></p>
<blockquote><p>Indemnity Dental Insurance Plan: This plan may be helpful when you want to stay with your dentist and he/she does not participate in a dental network. By the very nature of this plan the insurance company generally pays the dentist a percentage of your services according to the policy you purchased. In addition you will want to review the co-payment requirements, waiting periods, stated deductible, annual limitations, graduated percentage scales based on the type of procedure and/or length of time you have owned the policy prior to starting your dental work.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://insurancecent.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/den-c.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-69 aligncenter" src="https://insurancecent.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/den-c.jpg?w=300" alt="den c" width="300" height="210" /></a></p>
<p><b>Participating Provider Network (PPO)</b></p>
<blockquote><p>Participating Provider Network (PPO). Depending on your specific plan, the PPO works similar to a DHMO while using an In-Network facility. However, it allows you to use an Out-of-Network or Non-Participating Provider. Any difference of fees will become the financial responsibility of the patient unless otherwise specified in your dental policy. As noted, some dental insurance plans may have an annual maximum benefit limit. Thus, once the annual maximum benefit is exhausted any additional treatments may become the patient&#8217;s responsibility. Each year that annual maximum is reissued. The reissued date may vary as a calendar year, company fiscal year, or date of enrollment based on your specific plan.</p></blockquote>
<p><b>Dental Health Maintenance Organization (DHMO)</b></p>
<blockquote><p><b>Dental Health Maintenance Organization (DHMO)</b>: When a dentist signs a contract with a dental insurance company that provider agrees to accept an insurance fee schedule and give their customers a reduced cost for services as an In-Network Provider. Many DHMO insurance plans have little or no waiting periods, no annual maximum benefit limitations, while covering major dental work near the start of the policy period. This plan is sometimes purchased to help defray the high cost of the dental procedures. Some dental insurance plans offer free semi-annual preventative treatment. Fillings, crowns, implants and dentures may have various limitations.</p></blockquote>

<p>Travel help us to understand us more better by being ourself</p>
<p>As Most people live life caught up in a routine, and this can make it difficult to find time for reflection.</p>
<p>As an individual dedicated to becoming the best version of myself, it’s essential for me to step back to look at myself so that I can evaluate my strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>Although it’s not the only answer, (or the cheapest) again, travel can help.</p>
<p>so How does travel insurance work you must be wondering about it lets understand it better with &#8216;<a href="insurancecent.com" target="_blank">insurancecent</a>&#8216;</p>
<blockquote><p>Basically, <i>using</i> insurance begins as you encounter any problem after you&#8217;ve purchased coverage and before or during a trip.. a problem that puts your plans at risk and/or that threatens considerable cost beyond what you would normally encounter. (This won&#8217;t include coverage for essential steps on your trip that you failed to arrange for yourself, e.g., lodging, meals, fully adequate connection times between flights.)</p>
<p>Once you know the details of the problem (and any cost), you promptly contact the claims people for the company that issued your policy. You explain the situation, and they instruct you on what to do for a covered problem.</p>
<ul>
<li>For problems with modest cost that are covered, you&#8217;ll likely be told to pay the costs (preferably by credit card), keep all supporting bills/invoices/receipts, and to file a claim with the company after your trip is over.</li>
<li>For problems with great cost (e.g., overseas medical evacuation can cost a fortune), the insurer <i>may</i> do the same&#8230;though such costs can easily exceed the maximum &#8220;draw&#8221; allowed on your charge card. Better travel insurance also have &#8220;preferred providers&#8221; in numerous countries, one of which may be able to help you at lesser cost than others&#8230;or even provide the service you need and directly bill the insurer.</li>
<li>If you do not have the means to pay for what you need (and then wait for reimbursement), and no preferred provider can be used, some insurers will transfer funds to help. They do so only after being satisfied about costs encountered, and that they are sending the funds to and for someone who is covered.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://insurancecent.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/trav.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-63" src="https://insurancecent.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/trav.jpg?w=300" alt="trav" width="300" height="258" /></a></p>
<p>See &#8220;Making a claim&#8221; below for more discussion.</p>
<p>To wisely purchase coverage, carefully read the policy before buying to assure it provides coverage you need&#8230;per the discussions below.</p>
<p>To be able to use your policy and procedures effectively, print copies and take two or more in separate bags. In addition, take copies of the instructions on how to contact the insurer&#8217;s claims section&#8230;at least in two separate bags.</p></blockquote>
<p>So what are you waiting for the Sky is the Limit so enjoy the life at its best with travel insurance <img src="http://insurancecent.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>After health i think we all love our vehicle and almost every individual has its own vehicle for its personal use but what if you have a sudden accident and you vehicle get distorted and you get heavy bills to get it repair i hope you got my point here</p>
<p>this is where auto insurance came to rescue and save us from those heavy expenditures</p>
<p>so what is <strong>auto insurance</strong> ??</p>
<blockquote><p>Vehicle insurance (also known as, GAP insurance, car insurance, or motor insurance) is insurance purchased for cars, trucks, motorcycles, and other road vehicles. Its primary use is to provide financial protection against physical damage and/or bodily injury resulting from traffic collisions and against liability that could also arise there from the specific terms of vehicle insurance vary with legal regulations in each region. To a lesser degree vehicle insurance may additionally offer financial protection against theft of the vehicle and possibly damage to the vehicle, sustained from things other than traffic collisions you can get some very cheap auto insurance at a great price which can came handy later</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Benifits of Having auto insurance </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Your auto insurance policy includes more than just coverage for your vehicle. It also includes some added benefits (some that are standard, some you can add) that can help make your insurance experience as hassle-free as possible.</p>
<p>Accident Forgiveness: If you&#8217;ve been accident and violation-free for 5 years (no matter what insurance carrier you&#8217;ve been with), we won&#8217;t raise your rates due to your first accident. If you qualify, you&#8217;ll receive this benefit at no extra cost.</p>
<p>Lifetime Repair Guarantee: If your car is in an accident covered under your policy, you can have it fixed at one of our approved repair shops and the repairs will be guaranteed for as long as you own your vehicle.</p>
<p>Roadside Assistance: If your vehicle ever breaks down, we won&#8217;t leave you stranded. From a jump-start to a tow, our optional 24-Hour Roadside Assistance coverage will get you moving again &#8211; we&#8217;ll even make the arrangements.1</p>
<p>12-Month Rate Guarantee: Many auto insurance policies only last 6-months. This means that your rate can change after only half a year. At Liberty Mutual, our policies are for a full-year &#8211; guaranteeing your rate for an entire year.</p>
<p>Convenient Payment Options: Paying your bill should be quick and easy; whether over the phone, online or through our mobile app, there are a number of options at your disposal. Have your payments deducted automatically from your checking or savings account (Electronic Funds Transfer), pay by credit card, mail us a check – you decide.2</p>
<p>After-Hours Policy Services: Have a policy or billing question, or need to change your policy? You can call our customer service representatives for expert help with questions regarding your policy and billing after normal business hours and on weekends.</p></blockquote>

<p>After reading my earlier post you have got the ideas what obamacare means and what i does !! in this session i will be telling you how you can apply for obamacare and get the best affordable health insurance in quick time.</p>
<p>so lets get started how to choose obamacare</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>What is ObamaCare?:</strong> ObamaCare is the unofficial name for The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act which was signed into law on March 23, 2010 by President Barack Obama.</p></blockquote>
<p>Steps to follow to enroll into obamacare reform Sign up for Health Insurance Under the Affordable Care Act<br />
To sign up for ObamaCare find your state’s health insurance marketplace, sign up, then enroll. Sign up for ObamaCare during open enrollment.</p>
<p>Directions for signing up, details on fees, exemptions, enrollment periods, and information on what to do if you miss the ObamaCare deadline</p>
<p>Open Enrollment for Health Insurance<br />
2016 Open Enrollment in the Health Insurance Marketplace starts November 1st, 2015 and ends January 31st, 2016. Open enrollment for 2015 started November 15th, 2014 and ended February 15th, 2015.</p>
<p>Open enrollment is the only time of year everyone can obtain Minimum Essential Coverage. Each health insurance type has its own enrollment period. Coverage options outside of open enrollment include qualifying for a Special Enrollment Period, Medicaid, and CHIP. If you don’t have access to these consider your Short Term Health Insurance options.</p>
<p>1 in 6 Americans got a Marketplace plan for $100 or less. 87% of people who selected marketplace plans for 2015 got financial assistance. Are you covered? Contact HealthCare.Gov or a Qualified Broker to find out your options.</p>
<p>Options For Getting Covered Under ObamaCare</p>
<p>ObamaCare doesn’t eliminate private insurance – it just gives you more options for obtaining it. You can san still Shop For Coverage Outside Of The Marketplace. However, if you make between 100% – 400% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL), your first stop should always be your state’s marketplace or the official marketplace HealthCare.Gov. The marketplace is the only way to qualify for cost assistance. As soon as you sign up you’ll find out if you are eligible. You can then compare plans (with cost assistance automatically applied) before enrolling.</p>
<p>Healthcare.gov is the official Health Insurance Marketplace for states that didn’t set up their own marketplace. Make your first stop the marketplace and you’ll find out if you qualify for lower costs on coverage. Use other options, such as the form below, to get assistance outside of the Marketplace as well as quotes from outside the marketplace.</p>

<p>In the last post&#8217;s we read various aspects regarding what health insurance generally means why you should choose health insurance its benefit difference between term insurance and life insurance and insurance self.</p>
<p>we hope that is clear to you now in this post we will be giving you some great tips for affordable health insurance which can really benefit you as we know sometime insurance might be costly but if we go in a planned manner and know every thing about it then its not a problem to choose which is the best individual health insurance .</p>
<p>You can get Great affordable health insurance under the obama healthcare reform which is transforming lives of many people in United states of America at an affordable health insurance quote.</p>
<p>So <strong>what is obamacare</strong> ??</p>
<p>you might not be too much familier with this let me explain the initiative to you all</p>
<blockquote><p>The Affordable Care Act does a number of important things including offering Americans a number of new benefits, rights, and protections in regards to their healthcare, and setting up a Health Insurance Marketplace (healthcare .Gov) where Americans can purchase federally regulated and subsidized Health Insurance during open enrollment. The law also expands Medicaid, improves Medicare, requires you to have coverage in 2014 and beyond, and contains some new taxes and tax breaks, among other things.</p></blockquote>

<p>Aim of the <strong>obamacare</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>President Obama</strong> may have signed the Affordable Care Act into law, but the truth is obamacare is the result of decades of ideas from both sides of the isle and the health care industry. The idea of an individual mandate was first presented by current opponents of the law the Heritage Foundation in 1989. obamacareitself was in fact modeled after “Romney Care”, which is the nickname for the health care reform law implemented in the State of Massachusetts by then Governor Mitt Romney.</p></blockquote>

<p>So</p>
<blockquote><p>What does <strong>health insurance </strong>means ??</p></blockquote>
<p>Health insurance is insurance against the risk of incurring medical expenses among individuals. By estimating the overall risk of health care and health system expenses, among a targeted group, an insurer can develop a routine finance structure, such as a monthly premium or payroll tax, to ensure that money is available to pay for the health care benefits specified in the insurance agreement. The benefit is administered by a central organization such as a government agency, private business, or not-for-profit entity. According to the Health Insurance Association of America, health insurance is defined as &#8220;coverage that provides for the payments of benefits as a result of sickness or injury. Includes insurance for losses from accident, medical expense, disability, or accidental death and dismemberment</p>

Term insurance is the least expensive way to purchase a substantial death benefit on a coverage amount per premium dollar basis over a specific period of time.</p>

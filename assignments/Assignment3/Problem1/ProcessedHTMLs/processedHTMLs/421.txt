Unravel is cute and touching — and it’ll drive you mad, too

   [90]Jeff Grubb February 8, 2016 6:00 AM

   Electronic Arts is not known for dealing in cute. Professional
   football, military shooters, and Star Wars? Now, that’s EA. But a tiny
   little creature made of yarn may change that perception.

   Unravel is a new puzzle platformer from developer ColdWood Interactive.
   It stars a character named Yarny, who is the physical manifestation of
   the broken bonds between an aging woman and her estranged family. As
   Yarny, it is up to you to tie together the woman’s memories in an
   effort to bring her back together with the people she loves. This
   involves lots of jumping and using your yarn to solve challenges in
   your environment.

   A quick glimpse at the game will instantly confirm that all of this is
   as adorable as it sounds, but is it fun and does it deliver
   emotionally? I think so.

   IFRAME:
   [96]http://www.youtube.com/embed/bE0jF_O0MWQ?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autoh
   ide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent

What you’ll like

   The Swedish setting is striking

   While Yarny is the star of the game, I think that ColdWood
   Interactive’s home country of Sweden should get co-billing. Northern
   Europe is not something we often see in games, and Unravel makes an
   excellent argument for why we should see more of it.

   Running around a yard or through the woods is instantly enchanting
   because Yarny’s tiny scale makes the familiar surroundings feel
   magical. But that feeling persists because ColdWood isn’t just throwing
   a generic version of “the beach” at you for the level that takes you to
   the sea. You don’t stumble across brightly colored towels and beach
   balls as if you were at Beach City, U.S.A. Instead, this scene is shot
   through the prism of flinty cold Sweden. It makes Unravel’s world feel
   more personal.

   This shows the developer is confident enough in its art that it doesn’t
   need to use common shorthands (like snow means it is cold) to get its
   intentions across. Instead, you get the stillness of winter air and
   cracked, dry ground. You’ll climb up long-dead trees and walk over dead
   leaves that you can tell by their brown color fell weeks ago.

   This European realism lasts throughout the game. I was a bit stunned
   later on when I could tell a level was freezing cold even though the
   ground wasn’t covered in snow. In other games — especially platformers
   — a developer would just give you a snow level. A cold level always
   equals a snow level. But in Unravel, ColdWood — coming from a place
   that has all kinds of variety of chilly weather — isn’t afraid to
   portray that in different ways.

   The photorealistic visuals, combined with ColdWood’s willingness to
   show a more nuanced idea of what the world can look like, make every
   level feel like a real place.

   Yarny is alive

   Yarny is a character worth loving. He’s small but brave. He’s cute but
   capable. And ColdWood gets all of the emotions of the character across
   through smart animations.

   Early on, Yarny comes across a few butterflies. Without any input from
   the player, the game has our little hero stumble while trying to grab
   the insects. These sorts of moments occur again. Yarny shivers when he
   is freezing. He holds his arms out when he balances on moving objects.

   All of these subtle actions remind you that even though you’re in
   control of Yarny, he still has some feelings of his own. This
   effectively shows that he is the connection between you and the game in
   the same way that he is the bond between the woman and her memories and
   family. He lives in the space between all of this, and ColdWood knows
   that bringing him to life is an important way to help bridge the gap.

   And when I reached the story’s climax, I was deeply affected by it
   because I had grown so attached to my yarn friend.

   The puzzles are a decent challenge

   The world is beautiful, and the puzzles that populate this environment
   are often a pleasure to solve.

   Every challenge revolves around Yarny’s basic capabilities. These
   include his ability to lasso certain elements of the world with his
   yarn. From here, the hero can swing from and climb up objects. You can
   even push and pull objects around. This means you’ll have to do a lot
   of manipulating platforms to proceed.

   A great example of this is the Mountain Trek level, where you spend
   most of your time evading an angry chipmunk. During my epic battle with
   this adorable creature, who wanted to rip my poor Yarny apart, I had to
   lure him toward a mushroom to break it. I could then tie my yarn
   between two areas to make a trampoline. After swinging like Indiana
   Jones to get to the other side of the chipmunk’s cave, I had to use
   some poisonous fungi to ward off the animal so that I could lasso the
   boat behind him. I dragged the toy boat into the water and then lassoed
   onto a fish, who helped me get to the other side of the stream.

   None of this is especially difficult, but it’s still fun to look at the
   world and understand what it wants from you.

What you won’t like

   The controls are occasionally confusing and frustrating

   Unravel isn’t without its problems. One of the early levels has a swarm
   of mosquitoes continuously assaulting Yarny. This makes it difficult to
   move and jump, and it had me trying to rip apart my controller.

   Another example of frustration is a challenge near the end of the game
   where you need to drag a lantern up a snowy hill in the wind. If you
   don’t anchor yourself and the lantern to several checkpoints, you’ll
   get blown all the way back to the base of the incline. The problem is
   that Unravel wants you to connect the yarn to the hooks and to the
   lantern and to yourself in a very specific order. After getting blown
   back to the start for my tenth time, I cursed the game for not
   providing me with better instruction on how this was supposed to work.

   And I think that’s where most people will find a problem with Unravel.
   The yarn is fun and dynamic, but it is also finicky and unforgiving.

Conclusion

   ColdWood has succeeded in a handful of bold ways with Unravel. It is
   showing EA the value in smaller, quieter games. It also feels like
   another fresh take on the side-scrolling platformer. And while
   Unravel drove me mad a couple of times, I was mostly thrilled by its
   wonder and adventure.

   Score: 82/100

   Publisher Electronic Arts provided GamesBeat with a download code for
   this game for the purposes of our review. Unravel is due out February 9
   for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC.

   BOSTON – Milan Lucic was all smiles in the visiting Los Angeles Kings
   dressing room after taking his first twirl on the TD Garden ice as a
   non-home player at the morning skate Tuesday.

   Lucic skated with a smile on his face and a hello for many of the
   familiar faces he saw while going through the practice paces with his
   Kings teammates and there was a palpable excitement prior to suiting up
   for his first game vs. Boston after eight years as a diehard member of
   the Bruins.

   He certainly had that familiar twinkle in his eye when asked which
   Bruins player he’ll try to lay the first body check on once the puck is
   dropped.

   "Just anybody that gets in the way,” said Lucic. “That's the mentality
   that you have to have, right?"

   Clearly, though, the bruising left winger is hoping for a welcoming
   embrace from the fans at TD Garden, and a good, old-fashioned heavy
   hockey game that they appreciate most.

   “I think it’ll be a lot of fun. I think it’ll be a hard-fought game,
   and I think there’s a lot to look forward to for us at the start of a
   seven-game road trip. For myself, I get to play in the Garden as a
   visitor. It’s kind of weird being in the visiting locker room, but it’s
   nice to be back here in Boston,” said Milan Lucic. “It’s the place I
   started. You come here as a 19-year-old rookie, and when you have the
   success like I did a lot of things cross your mind. Especially when you
   get to achieve your ultimate dream of winning a Stanley Cup, and doing
   it with a group of guys that I got to do it with, and the organization
   that I got to do it with in the city with the fans and everything else.
   That’s what sticks out the most.

   “Getting to be a part of a Stanley Cup team on an Original Six team in
   a city where they really embrace their athletes and their sports teams
   [was special]. Those are the things that stick out in my mind, and
   really add to the emotion of tonight’s game.”

   Is Lucic hoping for a hero’s welcome from the Bruins fans as many other
   departed players from the 2011 Cup team have received in their first
   game back at the Garden?

   “It wouldn’t surprise me if they did [chant Looch!]. I think I had a
   pretty good relationship with the fans, and that’s what I said it’s
   exciting to be back here to play in front of them again,” said Lucic.
   “It’ll be different: different side, different room and getting ready
   for the game a little differently. But I just need to remind myself to
   approach this like any other road game where we’re trying to get two
   points tonight.”

   Were there any negative emotions from Lucic’s end when it came to being
   dealt away this summer after eight great years in Boston, or did he
   understand what was going to happen with the B’s coming off a
   disappointing season where they missed the playoffs?

   “Nothing negative. No hard feelings. Nothing like that. I understood
   the situation leading into the offseason, and sometimes things don’t
   last forever. I was ready and prepared for anything. I was ready and
   prepared to come back here, and I was ready and prepared if I had to
   move on,” said Lucic. “Luckily and thankfully I moved on to another
   really good team, and another contender. The Kings are a world class
   organization, and I’ve had a lot of fun in being a King so far.

   “I have no hard feelings about the trade, and there are definitely no
   regrets on my part in what I was able to accomplish [in Boston]. It’s
   just only good memories and good thoughts, and everything. I’m pretty
   fortunate that I got to be a Bruin in one of the best times to be a
   Bruin. They’ve only won six Cups in the 92 years that they’ve played,
   so it was a great time, and a special time, for me here, but I was also
   fortunate that I was able to move on to another great organization like
   the Kings.”

   It was odd seeing Lucic in the purple and gold Kings practice jerseys
   as they readied to don their original sweaters on Tuesday night to
   commemorate the 50th anniversary of LA being awarded the Kings
   franchise. Still, it will become all too real for Bruins players and
   fans alike once the first big Lucic hit is underway in that familiar
   spot in the corner, and once again that hulking physical presence has
   returned to the TD Garden ice.

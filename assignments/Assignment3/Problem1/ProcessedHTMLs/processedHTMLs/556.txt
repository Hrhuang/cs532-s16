Tigers Football

University of Memphis’ 2016 football schedule is set

   The University of Memphis’ 2016 football schedule is set.

   And at least on paper, it looks to be every bit as challenging as 2015.

   The Tigers will open conference play at home against Temple on a
   Thursday night, just five days after a trip to Ole Miss. They’ll finish
   the regular season with a grueling three-game stretch, hosting USF,
   visiting Cincinnati on a Friday and returning home to play Houston in
   the regular-season finale, which is also on a Friday.

   Back-to-back road games against Tulane and Navy, a home game against
   Tulsa and a trip to SMU round out the conference slate.

   Memphis’ schedule has a few drawbacks, including an early bye week
   (Week 2) and a short turnaround between games against Ole Miss and
   Temple, two teams with extremely physical defenses. The Tigers will
   also play two Friday road games, which may create travel difficulties
   for fans.

   But there are positives to the arrangement, too. In what will be Mike
   Norvell’s first season as a head coach, Memphis will play seven home
   games and five road games, including one that is only a short drive
   away in Oxford. At least five of its games will be nationally
   broadcast, including a pivotal Thursday night game against Temple.

   The Tigers recently completed their winningest two-year stretch in
   program history, following up a 10-3 season in 2014 with a 9-4 finish
   last year.

   They are scheduled to play their annual spring game April 22.

   The Tigers’ full 2016 schedule, and a list of known future
   nonconference matchups, is below.

'Bar Rescue' revamps George and Dragon in Phoenix, Baseline Sports Bar in
Tempe

   George and Dragon

   George and Dragon got a makeover courtesy of "Bar Rescue."(Photo:
   Kellie Hwang)

   The popular reality TV show is hosted by nightlife
   consultant Jon Taffer, who helps struggling bars by revamping
   their concepts. Changes often include interior and exterior renovation,
   retraining the staffs and updating the menus. The Phoenix episodes will
   likely air sometime in April. Spike TV's "Bar Rescue" made a whirlwind
   visit in January to the Valley, revamping George and Dragon in Phoenix
   and Baseline Sports Bar in Tempe.

   Here's a behind-the-scenes look.

George and Dragon English Restaurant & Pub

   David Wimberley, the British owner of George and Dragon, said he has
   seen every "Bar Rescue" episode and has even called bar owners who were
   on the show to get their impressions. He was preparing to take out
   a $100,000 loan to redo the 22-year-old pub, after losing $5,000 a
   month for the past two years. Wimberley had already obtained a $40,000
   loan to make changes in 2013. Then, "Bar Rescue" called.

   "They said they would be in town and 10 days later, they came to the
   bar," he said, noting Taffer called him "the most passionate bar owner
   he had ever met."

   Wimberley said he and Taffer, who is known as a tough, no-nonsense
   host, butted heads during the taping, and there was quite a bit of
   yelling and swearing. But by the end, Taffer became the "nicest guy on
   the planet." The makeover took 36 hours, and the bar went from a black
   and white color scheme to a warmer blue and brown one.

   The signage outside is all new, and the front door now features a Union
   Jack flag. The booths were taken out along with all of the chairs and
   tables, and replaced with pub-style, espresso-colored furniture. New
   carpets, track lighting and partitions were also added. The bar top was
   redone with color-changing lights underneath and new pendant lights
   overhead.

   "The changes turned out to be nice and I loved what they did to the
   pub," Wimberley said. "Some people have said it looks a bit too posh,
   too Scottsdale, but I like the way it looks. I was going to make some
   changes anyway. And I'm not losing money anymore."

   Not all of the changes were positive. Wimberley said the new
   point-of-sale system gave the staff some trouble after it was
   installed, which he doesn't blame on the show. He said it slowed down
   service and led to a couple of bad reviews from customers. All of the
   scarves and flags, many gifted from customers, were taken down during
   the filming, but Wimberley decided to put them back up.

   The menu was cut down for the show, and one dish in particular,
   called Taste of Britain, ended up being too time-consuming for the
   kitchen. So Wimberley removed that dish, and added a number of items
   back on, including the hummus appetizer, kids' menu and Sunday Roasts.
   A new list of cocktails, called Bevvies, include drinks like the
   Wimberley Cutter, the Cheeky Shuffle and Mum's Cup of Tea.

   When the George and Dragon episode airs, Wimberley will host a watch
   party at the bar. He plans to pause the show during certain parts to
   share his impressions and what else was going on, especially deleted
   scenes.

   Details: George and Dragon English Restaurant & Pub, 4240 N. Central
   Ave., Phoenix. 602-241-0018, [88]georgeanddragonpub.net.

Baseline Sports Bar (now Brick and Barley)

   Meanwhile, Baseline Sports Bar's revamp led to a name change: Brick and
   Barley. Owner A.J.Hunter, who has run the bar for 10 years and works
   with her two daughters, did not want to comment on the show until after
   it airs. The bar's Facebook pages (there are pages for both Baseline
   and Brick and Barley) features photos of Taffer's visit, including one
   of Hunter pretending to spar with the host.

   The bar features a new sign with a new name, inspired by the brick
   walls and beers on tap. Inside, there's more of an upscale pub feeling
   with a mustard yellow color scheme, stone accents, chandeliers and new
   lighting under the bar. The food menu is the same, and the patio
   features all-new furniture.

   Details: Brick and Barley, 201 E. Baseline Road,
   Tempe. 480-730-9800, [89]baselinesportsbar.com.

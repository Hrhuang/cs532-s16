   Hell Really Exists [20]http://bit.ly/1Osb8ve
   You were created to know God in a personal way—to have a relationship
   with Him, through His Son, Jesus Christ. How do you start a
   relationship with God?
   Realize that you are a sinner.
   No matter how good a life we try to live, we still fall miserably short
   of being a good person. That is because we are all sinners. The Bible
   says, "No one is good—not even one." We cannot become who we are
   supposed to be without Jesus Christ.
   Recognize that Jesus Christ died on the cross for you.
   The Bible tells us that "God showed His great love for us by sending
   Christ to die for us while we were still sinners." This is the Good
   News, that God loves us so much that He sent His only Son to die in our
   place when we least deserved it.
   Repent of your sin.
   The Bible tells us, "Repent of your sins and turn to God, so that your
   sins may be wiped away." The word repent means to change our direction
   in life. Instead of running from God, we can run toward Him.
   Receive Jesus Christ into your life.
   Becoming a Christian is not merely believing some creed or going to
   church. It is having Christ Himself take residence in your life and
   heart. Jesus said, "Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone
   hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in . . ." If you would
   like to have a relationship with Christ, simply pray this prayer and
   mean it in your heart.
   "Dear Lord Jesus, I know I am a sinner. I believe You died for my sins.
   Right now, I turn from my sins and open the door of my heart and life.
   I confess You as my personal Lord and Savior. Thank You for saving me.
   Amen."
   Did you pray this prayer?Yes No

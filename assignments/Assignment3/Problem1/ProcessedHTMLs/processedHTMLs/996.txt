Why executives came from New York to watch an amazing Arizona high school
basketball game

   One amazing Arizona high school basketball game attracts visitors from
   30 states Dianna Nanez/azcentral.com | The Republic

A basketball game is a first step toward bringing down invisible barriers for
eager high school students.

   Kellis High School Unified Sports basketball game

   takes a shot during the Unified Movement Special Olympics program

   At well over 6 feet tall, Phillipo Howery doesn’t need to stand on
   tippy toes. He’s not like the swarm of teenagers around him who lined
   the campus walkway on a recent Tuesday, all of them craning their necks
   and climbing on benches to see over the crowd cheering for the
   visitors.

   It’s just past noon, and the campus is filling with teachers, coaches,
   CEOs and athletes who came from as far as New York to see the big
   basketball game. One by one, they step off the tour bus, which had
   pulled up to Raymond S. Kellis High School on North 91st Avenue near
   Northern Avenue, where small farms and tract homes spread out in the
   western suburbs.

   “Woooo! Yaaaay!” the high schoolers shout. The steady thud of bass
   drums is the only sound from the marching band loud enough to carry
   over the screaming teenagers. Visitors, stunned by the over-the-top
   welcome, stop to take pictures. They pose for selfies inside the gaping
   mouth of an inflatable tunnel that looks like a cougar’s head.
   Then they make their way into the school’s auditorium.

   Across the hallway is the gym, where, when the pep rally ends, students
   will take part in a game with athletes who not so long ago wouldn't
   have had the chance to play.

   Phillipo is watching, taking it all in. He doesn’t need to stand on his
   tippy toes to see the scene. But he does.

   When Phillipo gets excited, he has a habit. Like the thin branches of a
   paloverde bending under the force of a summer wind, the lanky boy leans
   forward as if he might fall. He rises up, clenches his hands and laughs
   in shouts and bursts.

   Phillipo is 15. He looks like a little boy when his eyes grow big and
   his mouth opens wide to holler and he waves at everyone here to see his
   team play.

   On the basketball court, there is nothing little or boyish about
   Phillipo. He’s fierce. So fierce, coaches had to teach him how to
   control his emotions so he could focus on his game and on the reason
   these kids are here to play.

     [89]On World AIDS Day, Phoenix remembers

     [90]How a rescued pit bull changed a man's life, and how he said
   goodbye

   He can’t wait.

   But first he has to walk to the front of the auditorium, stand at the
   podium and give a speech in front of everyone.

   He waits for the principal, a hype-man who gets the crowd going with
   school chants: “Cougar pride, is it in you?” Then he waits as the
   audience watches a video, set to a pop-music soundtrack and starring
   high-school athletes. Finally, all the other speakers who take the
   stage before Phillipo have had their turn.

   He hears his teacher Michael Wakeford call his name: “Is Phillipo in
   the house?”

   He can hear the sound of teenagers screaming for him echoing through
   the dark auditorium. Phillipo hurries up the steps as Wakeford is
   finishing his introduction.

   “Phillipo Howery is a current Special Olympic athlete here at Kellis
   High School,” Wakeford says, raising his voice over the cheering crowd.
   “And you’ll see him and his abilities in the basketball game.”

   Abilities. It’s a word you’ll hear over and over at Kellis, a place
   where teenagers have been taught that everyone is different and
   everyone is able.

   Phillipo doesn’t know it yet, but in a few days, leaders with
   [91]Special Olympics Arizona will speak at an international conference
   at the United Nations headquarters in Austria, spotlighting athletes
   like him to an audience of hundreds of dignitaries from more than 50
   countries. Athletes who play in Special Olympics Unified Sports
   programs across the nation with one goal: Unite students with all
   levels of physical and developmental abilities and disabilities.

   Arizona's program has been so successful it was selected as a model for
   inclusion, which global policymakers hope to see replicated across the
   world.

   But right now, it’s Phillipo’s turn in the spotlight. He takes the
   stage. It’s his time to speak.

Tearing down invisible barriers

   There are nearly 2,000 students enrolled at Kellis High. About half the
   school is economically disadvantaged. Ethnic minority enrollment is
   just over 61 percent and testing scores are on par with the district’s
   other seven schools, according to a U.S. News & World Report analysis.

   If you ask Kellis students, these are all just a bunch of numbers. What
   sets their school apart is how, at a time when high schools across
   America continue to battle bullying, teens on their campus go out of
   their way to show they care about each other.

   If you ask teachers, the camaraderie they’ve built among Kellis
   students has everything to do with the [92]Special Olympics’ Project
   Unify program. The program mixes sports and education to engage
   students with and without disabilities in athletics and leadership
   opportunities. Students with disabilities and those without are
   partnered so that they learn lessons from each other about life on and
   off the field.

   “We want our students to have that social inclusion, that’s our whole
   goal.”
   Isaac Sanft, Arizona Unified Sports program director for Special
   Olympics Arizona

   The program also includes opportunities for students who prefer drama
   or arts over sports. Special Olympics executives say the idea is to
   create a culture on campus where students in special education programs
   are as much a part of the school as students on the cheerleading,
   basketball or other athletic teams.

   “We want our students to have that social inclusion, that’s our whole
   goal,” says Isaac Sanft, a director with Special Olympics Arizona who
   heads the organization's [93]Arizona Unified Sports program. “And we
   see that barrier, we see where individuals with disabilities are not
   included.”

   Sanft says the first time he walks onto an Arizona school campus,
   before he meets with officials to discuss launching a Project Unify
   program, he often tries to gauge how inclusive the school is. He starts
   by asking students and adults on campus if they can direct him to the
   school’s special-education area. He often gets the same answer.

   “I’ll hear, ‘I don’t know,’” he says. “And those few who do know, they
   can’t name one special-education student and they don’t know who those
   (special-education) teachers are.”

   Sanft calls these the invisible barriers that leave children with
   disabilities out of the traditional high-school experience.

'The great equalizer'

   In 2011, Special Olympics Arizona took a major step in breaking down
   barriers.

   That’s when the organization partnered with the Arizona Interscholastic
   Association to sanction the Unified Sports program. Now, students who
   play on Unified Sports teams have the opportunity to earn school
   letters for athletics.

   Sanft likes to boast about students who have earned their letterman
   jackets.

   “We use sports as the great equalizer,” Sanft says. “It’s about seeing
   the abilities in everyone.”

   A few days before the big game, Sanft is making preparations for the
   visitors traveling to the school. He’s also prepping for a trip to
   Europe, where he will talk about Project Unify in Arizona.

   Sanft has been working mostly on caffeine and adrenaline. It’s not
   every day, he says, an Arizona school program for students with
   disabilities gets national and international attention in the same
   month.

   Last summer, Sanft and his team at Special Olympics Arizona were
   discussing the growing success of Arizona’s Unified Sports program.
   They wanted more people to know the changes happening at schools like
   Kellis.

   What Sanft says he really wanted was to see a Project Unify at every
   school in Arizona, and then at every school in the world. Sanft likes
   to think big.

   But even non-profits with a global reach struggle to make changes at
   the pace they want, he says. So his team came up with the idea of
   applying to present at the Zero Project conference, an international
   gathering that spotlights the best programs and policies for improving
   the lives of people with disabilities.

   The Zero Project is an initiative launched by the Austria-based Essl
   Foundation, a charity that funds programs for people in need. Each
   year, the Zero Project receives hundreds of applications from across
   the globe to present at the conference at the United Nations
   headquarters in Austria. Judges select 100 model programs that “improve
   the daily lives and legal rights of all persons with disabilities,”
   according to the organization’s website.

   An estimated 500 world policymakers, leaders and diplomats will gather
   the second week of February at the conference as researchers, educators
   and others share their work. Sanft will take the stage as one of two
   Special Olympics Arizona workers who will speak about Project Unify and
   its athletes.

   “I’m excited,” he says.

   He’s also nervous. But for now, he’s focusing on the rally and the big
   game at Kellis.

'We are able'

   On this particular Tuesday, Sanft is among the hundreds of people at
   Kellis who look a little stunned by the students who are shouting for
   each other, exchanging hugs and high fives and comforting those who
   start to cry.

   The tears come as parents and athletes, with and without disabilities,
   take the stage to talk about what Unified Sports means to them.

   In the auditorium, Unified Sports athletes are wearing their uniforms.
   Other students and teachers are wearing T-shirts in different colors
   with the same message: “We are able.”

   Students at Kelllis know their Unified Sports program has quietly built
   a national reputation for their school in the western suburbs of metro
   Phoenix. That reputation has attracted Tuesday’s visitors from across
   the United States for a pep rally and the game between Kellis’ Unified
   basketball team and neighboring Sunrise Mountain High School’s Unified
   team.

   Seated in the Kellis auditorium are educators, coaches, CEOs and
   Special Olympics executives. They are there to learn more about the
   Special Olympics Unified Sports program and to gauge whether it will
   work at their community's school.

   In a seat at the south end of the auditorium is Timothy Shriver,
   chairman of Special Olympics. The group was founded in 1968 by his
   mother, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, and has grown from a few hundred
   athletes to more than 4.5 million athletes in 170 countries.

   Kellis principal Jeff Wooten asks the students to clap for their guests
   and for each other. He asks everyone to look under their seats. People
   reach down and pick up notes on papers about the size of index cards.

   “Those are pledges from last year to eliminate the R-word,” he says,
   describing the school's effort to stop young people from using a
   certain slur.

   On one yellow card at a seat near the back of the room it says:

   I pledge and support the elimination of the derogatory use of the
   r-word from everyday speech and promote the acceptance and inclusion of
   people with intellectual disabilities.

   That card is signed in black ink by a student named Vanessa.

   When Wakeford, the teacher who runs Kellis’ Unified Program, takes the
   stage, students scream for him like he’s their favorite YouTube star.

   “Wakeford! Wakeford!”

   Wakeford turns the attention to his Unified Sports athletes and their
   parents speaking at the rally.

   Students without disabilities who graduated from Kellis talk about
   having found their calling in special education after participating in
   Unified Sports. Parents whose students have graduated from the program
   talk about the changes they saw in their children. A couple of students
   with disabilities who graduated show off their navy-blue letterman
   jackets. One yells: “Cougar Pride, is it in you!”

   And then, there’s Phillipo Howery, a current basketball star on the
   Kellis Unified Sports team. Wakeford teases Phillipo as he makes his
   way to the stage.

   “And I know he’s not nervous about the basketball game, but he might be
   a little nervous right now, huh?”

   “You got this Phillipo!” someone shouts.

'It has changed my life'

   Phillipo struts across the stage wearing white sneakers and his
   navy-blue basketball uniform. He’s holding a couple of sheets of paper.

   Wakeford pats him on the arm. Phillipo grins and sets his papers, the
   ones that he wrote his speech on, atop the podium.

   Wakeford was wrong. Phillipo is not nervous. He’s been practicing for
   the crowd of executives, athletes and his peers. And with Noah
   Enriquez, Phillipo’s partner in Unified Sports.

   Phillipo has something to say about people with disabilities, about
   Noah and about basketball. It’s his turn to speak.

   “After being in Unified Sports, I felt like more confidence in myself
   because I felt acceptance.”
   Phillipo Howery, Kellis High School student with disabilities and
   Unified Program athlete

   “Good morning, everybody. My name is Phillipo Howery. I would like to
   start by saying thank you to you all for being here today. I felt
   honored to be given the opportunity to speak about Unified Sports — it
   has changed my life,” he says.

   Phillipo pauses to look at his papers, as if to make sure he’s got the
   words right.

   “I am very good and competitive at sports and I want to be challenged
   by other athletes. My favorite sports are basketball first, football
   next and track last.”

   Phillipo thanks his Unified Sports partner and cracks a joke about Noah
   looking like Justin Bieber and wrestling like John Cena. (Noah wrestles
   for Kellis' Varsity wrestling team.) Everyone laughs.

   “Noah taught me how to throw a football … and before that, I taught him
   a few things on the basketball court, as well,” he says.

   He talks about their special handshake. About their friendship. And
   then about the sports program that focuses on his abilities.

   “After being in Unified Sports, I felt like more confidence in myself
   because I felt acceptance,” he says.

   He picks up his papers and walks past the podium and past two signs
   posted for everyone to see.

   One says: “Everyone is special. Everyone is different.” The other is
   just a symbol: The letter “R” crossed out.

   “It is possible to live in a place where people are valued for who they
   are. It is possible to teach children to grow up so that they look at
   each other with love and respect. It is possible to grow up and
   discover that your best self is the self you give away.”
   Timothy Shriver, Special Olympics chairman

   The principal is about to introduce the school’s Unified dance team
   members, who will close out the rally. But first he asks Shriver, the
   international Special Olympics leader, if he’d like to say a few words.

   Shriver thanks the students, the educators, the coaches and the CEOs,
   who came from 30 states for a special rally and the big game. He asks
   them to think about what they are seeing, and taking part in, at Kellis
   High in Arizona:

   “That it is possible to live in a place where people are valued for who
   they are. It is possible to teach children to grow up so that they look
   at each other with love and respect. It is possible to grow up and
   discover that your best self is the self you give away. It is
   possible.”

   As the crowd cheers, the athletes head to the gym to get ready for the
   game. Phillipo knows it’s almost time to play basketball.

   He’s ready. He’s been waiting.

   When he’s on the court his partners pass him the ball. He makes more
   baskets than he misses. His classmates in the bleachers scream each
   time either team makes a shot.

   When the buzzer sounds, and the game is over, no one pays attention to
   the score. Everyone in the bleachers rushes the court to rally for the
   athletes.

   Phillipo is out of breath. A reporter asks him about the shots he made
   and what he thinks was his best run on the court.

   He nods his head, smiles and says, “My favorite moment was to have
   fun."

   A teammate walks up next to him. He wraps his arm around Phillipo. They
   walk off the court, together.

Amazon wants game developers to use its new free 3D engine

   5 Days left: TNW Europe early bird sales end soon. Learn more!

   Amazon has a surprise: it’s built a free, open-source 3D engine for
   game developers called [53]Lumberyard. Built for “AAA” games, the
   engine integrates the company’s AWS cloud platform deeply to provide
   server-side processing.

   Lumberyard is a full game studio; you can build and design levels,
   create your visuals, animate characters, generate particles, engineer
   audio, handle weather and AI and basically everything else you can
   imagine. It provides both the infrastructure for the multiplayer
   component of the game as well as the tools to build the game itself.

   The game engine [54]uses Cryengine for graphics, which can generate
   ‘photo-realistic’ worlds — it’s best known for being the engine behind
   the PC-crippling [55]Crysis games.

   A [56]new AWS service called GameLift is integrated into the app to
   provide scalable multiplayer architecture without requiring deep
   infrastructure skills. The company touts that using GameLift means
   developers don’t need to spend “thousands of hours” building out this
   infrastructure, instead promising it takes just a matter of minutes.

   The new platform also offers deep Twitch integration, so developers can
   build in impressive new features to games. [57]Twitch ChatPlay
   developers can build features that allow observers to join in with game
   streams by voting on levels or the game’s direction and [58]Twitch
   JoinIn lets broadcasters instantly invite viewers to join them in-game.

   It’s obvious why the company is making Lumberyard available for free —
   as Microsoft has leveraged Azure for Xbox Live, Amazon wants game
   developers to use its cloud as well.

   By building a tool like Lumberyard and making it freely available, the
   company is actively encouraging both developers and designers to deeply
   integrate Amazon’s cloud stack into their titles; ultimately, it’s
   locking them in long-term.

   The most impressive part of Lumberyard is that it’s both entirely free
   and the code is available for developers to modify. Other game engines
   can cost developers in the thousands and often charge for per-seat
   pricing, so Amazon’s proposition is likely interesting for both large
   and small game developers.

   Recruitment is different in every company. The processes depend on
   company sizes, hiring needs and efforts put by the recruitment team.
   There are three leading actors in any recruitment process - recruiters,
   candidates and employees.


   [15]It is proven that referrals are the best way to hire today[16].
   Then, why is the success ratio so low in many companies?


   [17]A great candidate experience is the key to conversions. Then, why
   are we unable to provide one? It is because we still haven’t been able
   to bridge the gap of engagement with both - employees and candidates.
   We are still following the traditional ways to do so without realising
   that our audience has changed. We are hiring a generation that is
   exceptionally social and has a short span of attention. As a result, we
   have to adopt newer ways to engage them.


   Have you heard about gamification? What strikes your mind when you
   first hear it?


   Games? Points? Winning and losing? Ranking? It’s similar. Gamification
   is a subtle science of psychology. It is the science of applying game
   mechanics and techniques to business scenarios to achieve tangible
   results. We all have played enough games to know the impact it creates
   on our minds. You start again even when you have lost a game
   repeatedly. We do so because we are challenged to achieve a certain
   goal.


   When it comes to employees, gamification can engage them and help you
   get referrals. Monetary incentives aren’t the only driver to refer
   somebody today. Recognition and other non monetary rewards are equally
   important. Employees want to be recognized for helping the company by
   bringing in a great new employee. You can give them points, badges and
   recognize them. While points, badges, leaderboard and levels are most
   commonly known, the key facet of gamification is activity loops.
   Activity loop is the science of bringing about repetitive behaviour
   while making the process fun. For example, submitting time sheets is a
   boring and repetitive activity. Gamifying it the right way can result
   in people engaging in repetitive loops to file their timesheets before
   the deadline. There are four ways in which you can use the game
   elements to perform the following actions in a referral process:


    1. Recommend friends: Game elements can propel them to perform the
       actions and make sourcing easy for you. You can define some points
       for referring, some more if their referral is shortlisted and
       upgrade their level once the referral is offered the job. We have
       seen that in 8 out of 10 times, an employee does not see success
       with his/her referrals. These points and badges encourage them to
       participate again even after facing failure.


    2. Share the jobs on social media: When employees share the jobs on
       their social network, they are not only sharing jobs but also
       spreading the company culture. It becomes a catalyst for candidates
       to apply. Gamification can be used to drive social shares. Define
       badges that the employees will get if they share each job on all of
       their social networks. Run the same activity for a week and reward
       the employee who shares a job most number of times. This
       incentivizes them to participate and when their referral is hired,
       they are automatically motivated to do it again.


    3. Post offer engagement: We all lose top candidates at the offer
       stage. It hurts when everybody in team finally agrees on a
       candidate but they don’t join. Would it not be awesome if the
       employee could talk the candidate into joining the company? The
       impact created when an employee explains them about growth and
       opportunities in the company is huge. You could easily incentivise
       this behaviour too.


    4. Onboarding: Now that their referral has accepted the offer,
       employees can also be encouraged to help recruiters with a good
       onboarding. A mainstream onboarding process usually includes a lot
       of documentation. They can be recognized as employee of the month
       or quarter for helping mentor a friend/colleague get started well.


   A good company culture’s only drawback is that a lot of people want to
   join your company. In which case, you can start by assessing who fits
   the skill set.


   You can run coding competitions, hackathons, assessments for a
   particular role, etc. because you can’t assess each of them one by one
   and this eliminates junk. A gamified hiring process is one that makes
   employers more attractive in the eyes of job seekers. Think about the
   competitions organised by tech giants like Google or Facebook –
   [18]Google Code Jam and the [19]Facebook Hacker Cup. These both
   resulted in two-fold gains: more exposure and an opportunity to acquire
   fresh talent.


   These competitions can be run on points, badges and levels. Usually,
   the competitions go on for weeks and engaging candidates becomes tough.
   A live leaderboard can keep them engaged. Showing their competitions
   boosts them to give their best. Grouping them can help in choosing the
   best faster. You can also measure some soft skills like time
   management, teamwork spirit, the passion about their work, etc.


   Another good idea for candidate focused websites or career site is to
   provide a neat progress bar so candidates can instantly see how far
   they are into the recruitment process, helping them to focus on
   reaching later stages and completing the goal.


   While gamification can have a tremendous impact on how you identify and
   hire people, it can be just as powerful—if not more so—as a tool for
   keeping them engaged after they have been hired. Engagement has become
   a hot topic today, with [20]Gallup reportingthat nearly 70% of U.S.
   employees overall (and more than 70% of Millennials specifically) are
   not engaged employees. Given that [21]ADP estimates the cost to a
   company of just one disengaged employee is more than $2,200 a year,
   it’s no wonder businesses are looking for ways to encourage employee
   engagement.


   Gamification in companies is becoming so popular that, according to
   Gartner research covered in a Harvard Business Review blog post,
   [22]elements of gaming will be used in 25% of redesigned business
   processes by 2015, and 70% of Global 2000 businesses expected to manage
   at least one gamified application or system.


   The power of gamification comes down to this:

   It taps into the competitive fires that we all have. As we play a game,
   we become more engaged. We are willing to go the extra mile to achieve
   the goals and attain a greater sense of accomplishment.

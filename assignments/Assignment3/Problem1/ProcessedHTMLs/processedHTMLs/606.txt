Royals to hold two World Series ceremonies, force Mets to watch

   It apparently wasn't enough for the [91]Kansas City Royals to make the
   [92]New York Mets watch them celebrate winning the World Series at Citi
   Field after pulling off a thrilling comeback win in Game 5 last
   November.

   The Royals are going to have not one, but two World Series
   ceremonies over the [93]regular season's opening week, according to
   Adam Rubin of ESPN.

   Their opponent for that very first series of the 2016 season? None
   other than those very same Mets.

   When the two teams meet for the first time on Apr. 3, the Royals will
   raise their championship banner Two days later on Apr. 5, Kansas City's
   players will receive their championship rings. The Mets? They'll have
   to watch, just like they did back on their own home field when the
   Royals earned the right to celebrate with as many ceremonies as they
   would like.

   The reason for the two-day split is pretty simple on the Royals' part.
   Because the opener is being aired on ESPN's Sunday Night Baseball,
   there are restrictions as to [95]how much of the ceremony they'll be
   able to show on TV, according to ESPN.

     "We decided to move the ring ceremony to the second game of the
     season so our entire fan base could feel like they are a part of
     it," said Kevin Uhlich, Royals' Senior Vice President of Business
     Operations.  "While it's great that ESPN has selected our season
     opener for their first primetime telecast, only our fans in
     attendance would have the opportunity to witness the entire ring
     ceremony. By moving the ceremony to Tuesday, our partners at FOX
     Sports Kansas City can carry the ring presentation in its entirety
     for all fans to see."

   Fair enough. These are the decisions a team can make when they're the
   champs.

   Three games is all that separates the Garden City men’s basketball team
   from fourth place in the KJCCC. But a 13th-place finish is just
   one-and-a-half games away for the currently ninth-place Busters with
   five games to play in the regular season.

   But for now, finishing in the top eight is the biggest goal for the
   Busters because that guarantees a home game for the first round of the
   Region VI tournament, an advantage the Busters have not been able to
   enjoy in each of head coach Brady Trenkle’s first two seasons.

   The result each of those seasons? A loss and a quick elimination from
   regionals.

   The Busters (14-11, 6-8) are tied for eighth in the conference, but
   drop to ninth on a head-to-head tiebreaker with Butler, which edged the
   Busters, 81-75, way back on Dec. 2, the first game of the conference
   season.

   “You always want to finish as high as you,” Trenkle said. “With five
   games to go now, there’s a lot of space to move. We were just in
   seventh a week ago.”

   But after losses to Hutchinson and Barton — the latter on a tip-in at
   the buzzer — the Busters are now facing the the unenviable task of
   going on the road for the region first round once again.

   Two years ago, the Busters were on the wrong end of a four-team
   tiebreaker for third place in the Jayhawk West, forcing them to travel
   to Neosho County, where they lost 74-59.

   Last year, they finish seventh in the unbalanced Jayhawk West, and
   traveled to Hutchinson, where the Busters nearly pulled off the upset,
   falling 70-68. Hutchinson went on to win the region.

   Garden City is not the only team that has struggled on the road in
   region play, with home teams going 17-4 in the last three seasons.
   Though, last year was an outlier as home teams went just 3-3.

   But Trenkle and the Busters can’t worry about that now — they’ve got to
   focus on the five games in front of them, with three of them at home.
   Protect home court and steal one or maybe two on the road, and the
   Busters likely will have one more home date at the Perryman Athletic
   Complex.

   “We’ve just got to worry about Dodge City,” Trenkle said of the
   Busters’ next opponent, the fourth-place Conqs who come to Garden City
   for a 7:30 p.m. tip-off Wednesday. “We’ve just got to take them one at
   a time, and at the end of it all, you want to win five in a row and
   finish 11-8.”

   The Busters also are taking one surgery at a time during a season with
   perhaps more than their fair share of injuries. The most recent were a
   couple of surgeries for guard Jamar Gilbert and Dionte Jones.

   Gilbert is out indefinitely for now, and Jones is a game-time decision
   for Wednesday.

   “It’s just been one of those years,” Trenkle said.

   Gilbert was playing 20.4 minutes per game, scoring 6.8 points and was
   the Busters’ leader in assists per game at three. Jones was averaging
   8.1 points and 6.1 rebounds per game, leading the Busters in the latter
   category.

   After the Conqs (9-5) — who the Busters beat, 74-71, at the Dodge City
   Civic Center on Jan. 20 — the Busters travel to Colby Saturday. The
   seventh-place Trojans (7-7) and Busters tangled in a high-intensity
   game on Jan. 24, with the Busters getting the best of the scoreboard,
   72-65.

   Then, the Busters return home to host sixth-place Seward County on Feb.
   17. The Saints (7-6) won the previous meeting with Garden City, 92-87,
   on Jan. 27 at the Greenhouse. The Busters’ final road game of the
   regular season is a long trip to Concordia and last-place Cloud County
   on Feb. 20. The T-Birds (2-14) snapped a nine-game losing streak with a
   76-74 win over Seward County Saturday.

   In their previos meeting with the Busters, Garden City won a close one,
   73-70, on Jan. 30. To close the regular season, the Busters host
   first-place Hutchinson. The Dragons (12-3) smacked the Busters on Feb.
   1 in an 83-64 win.

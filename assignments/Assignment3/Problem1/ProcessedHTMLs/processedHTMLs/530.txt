     * [69]<p>As you age, your body's ability to absorb vitamin B12 from
       food slows—4 out of every 100 women ages 40 to 59 are B12
       deficient, and many more are borderline. But celebrating another
       birthday isn't the only cause: Avoiding meat, taking certain
       drugs—like Metformin (commonly prescribed to people with type 2
       diabetes or polycystic ovary syndrome) or some common heartburn
       medications—and even having weight loss surgery all up your odds.

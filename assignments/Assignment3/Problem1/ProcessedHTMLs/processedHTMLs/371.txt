   Sports reporter and anchor Trenni Kusnierek speaks with Lake Effect's
   Mitch Teich.

   You couldn't blame sports anchor and Milwaukee area native Trenni
   Kusnierek for being a bit apprehensive about speaking publicly on her
   struggles with depression and anxiety. After all, the sports world in
   which she plies her trade thrives on an image of strength. Kusnierek
   worried about what she might hear from her new bosses at Comcast
   SportsNet New England. Or her viewers. Or the athletes she covered.

   But when she told her story in a [71]2012 Milwaukee Magazine article,
   something unexpected happened. "Social media being what it is," she
   says, "I thought at the very least there would be a handful of people
   in my Twitter mentions or that would email me at work, or comment on
   the article saying something terrible and nasty."

   But that didn't happen. "I don't think I encountered one negative
   comment. Not one person said, 'You you're just crazy, it's all in your
   head,' or 'You shouldn't put her on the air.'"

   And so, encouraged by this reaction, Kusnierek has, in the years since,
   become a public advocate for increased understanding of others facing
   mental health challenges - including some of the athletes she covers.

   Kusnierek updated her own story in personal essay in February's
   [72]Milwaukee Magazine.

   "If there's one thing that's changed about me," she says, "I think I've
   become a more empathetic person." She points to athletes whose lives
   are spiraling out of control - such as Cleveland Browns quarterback
   Johnny Manziel - and says there's a key ingredient missing from the
   typical discussion these athletes engender.

   "He's at a depth that is so low that he would rather die than get
   help," Kusnierek says. And she believes that's typical for people
   dealing with profound mental health issues. "There's such an amount of
   shame and guilt around your disease. You don't just turn to alcohol and
   drugs just because.  There's something that often triggers it."

   But for all of her increased empathy and understanding, Kusnierek also
   knows the climate in professional sports hasn't fully responded to the
   mental health challenges athletes face. "At the end of the day,
   professional athletes - they're regular human beings," she says, "and
   they struggle with things other human beings struggle with - be it
   depression, anxiety, addiction or even cancer. And the only one out of
   all of those that people ever seem to have a real empathy for is
   something like cancer."

   The good news for Trenni Kusnierek is that people continue to like her
   work, and she says, she feels like her employers have her back, as
   well. And at the same time, she's been in a position to support some of
   her colleagues. "I've had a lot of broadcasters and writers and
   reporters approach me and say, 'listen, I don't feel comfortable
   talking about it publicly, but I struggle with anxiety.' Or, 'my son is
   going through this - how can I help him feel like he's not so alone?'"

   And that role, Kusnierek says, may be the best result of an interview
   she gave more than three years ago.

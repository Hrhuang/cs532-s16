Wanted agent: PM offered to trade marines for proof against Sonia

   Charu Sudan Kasturi

   New Delhi, Feb. 1: A British arms agent wanted by Indian investigators
   in a helicopter scam has accused the Narendra Modi government of
   offering Italy the freedom of two marines in exchange for evidence
   linking Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and her family to the corruption
   that hit the headlines in 2013.

   Christian Michel, the 54-year-old agent, has made the allegations in a
   letter to the International Tribunal of the Law of the Seas in Hamburg
   and the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) at The Hague where Italy
   and India are battling legally over murder charges against the marines.

   This newspaper could not independently verify Michel's allegations.

   "The charges are too ridiculous to comment on," foreign ministry
   spokesperson Vikas Swarup told The Telegraph which shared Michel's
   letter with the government for its response.

   Till late Monday night, the Italian Prime Minister's office had not
   responded to an email seeking their response.

   But Michel told this newspaper from Dubai: "I know these are serious
   allegations, but I stand by them."

   Michel has claimed Modi made the offer at a secret "brush-by" meeting
   with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi during the UN General Assembly
   in September 2015 when both leaders were in New York.

   "At this meeting, the issue of the two marines was discussed," Michel
   wrote through his lawyers in his letter dated December 23, 2015. "The
   Indian PM proposed to the Italian PM that in return for any evidence
   that the key adviser to Finmeccanica/ AgustaWestland (this is a
   reference to myself) had any relationship to any member of the Gandhi
   family, the honourable PM would assist in solving the case against the
   two Italian marines."

   Neither India nor Italy has ever officially acknowledged such a
   "brush-by" meeting between Modi and Renzi in New York.

   Asked, the Indian ministry of external affairs did not deny Michel's
   claim of the "brush-by" meeting between Modi and Renzi, citing the
   presence of "so many world leaders there" to contend that a brief
   conversation was always possible.

   "Brush-by" meetings are unscheduled interactions between leaders, often
   on the move, at times unplanned and on other occasions used to build in
   deniability. The two Prime Ministers are known to have spoken at least
   once on the telephone, on August 11, 2014, when Renzi dialled Modi
   asking for a "rapid, positive decision" on the marines, according to
   the Italian Prime Minister's office.

   The Italian marines are accused of shooting two Kerala fishermen dead
   in February 2012 and the charges against them have dragged India's
   relationship with Italy, once an important defence partner, to its
   lowest since Independence.

   AgustaWestland, a subsidiary of the Italian firm Finmeccanica at the
   time, was the firm that in 2010 won the contract to supply 12 choppers
   to India for Rs 3,600 crore, specifically to fly the President,
   Vice-President and Prime Minister at high altitudes.

   In 2013, Italian prosecutors accused Finmeccanica executives of paying
   bribes to Indian officials, including former air force chief S.P. Tyagi
   and his brothers, through Michel and another middleman, Ralph Haschke,
   to swing the deal.

   An Italian court acquitted the middlemen on the charge of
   "international corruption", but India, which began its own
   investigation into the case, is still pursuing the allegations.

   Michel, wanted by the Enforcement Directorate - which has turned to the
   Interpol to look for him - told this newspaper from Dubai, where he now
   works, that he had also written to Modi in November.

   "I think the Prime Minister is inherently a decent man, and I wasn't -
   and still am not - sure if he understands fully the implications of
   what he is being advised, which is why I wrote to him," Michel said.

   In his letter to the two international courts, Michel has claimed he
   came to know of the meeting and conversation between Modi and Renzi
   through three sources in Finmeccanica while his lawyers were
   negotiating a settlement with the firm on outstanding claims. Michel
   has said in his letter that he was willing to divulge his sources to
   the international courts "in a confidential manner".

   A November 20, 2012, report in the Italian newspaper Lettera 43 had
   linked Michel's father Wolfgang - a businessman known to be close to
   the Labour Party - to the Congress.

   "His (Michel's) contacts are stronger especially with Indian defence,
   that he has inherited from his father Wolfgang Max Michel Richard, a
   British businessman who was very active in India in the 1980s and 1990s
   and was close to the Congress party," the report had said. Both the
   Congress and Michel had denied any proximity.

   "I have never met any member of the Gandhi family," Michel said today.

   Michel's allegations come at a time India and Italy are in secret talks
   to try and resolve political differences over the marines' case even as
   legal proceedings are continuing internationally.

   Neither nation expects the other to drop legal proceedings - the
   Permanent Court of Arbitration has even set a schedule through 2016 for
   depositions by India and Italy. But Italy wants India to allow both the
   marines to return to Rome - a sensitive issue politically for Renzi.

   One of them, Massimiliano Latorre, is already in Italy, allowed by
   India's Supreme Court to recuperate from a surgery to remove a brain
   tumour. Salvatore Girone, the other marine, is still in India, which
   wants a set of diplomatic and legal commitments from Italy before
   agreeing to his return to Rome under negotiations officials have
   described as a "road map".

   Michel's claims represent the first time anyone directly associated
   with either the helicopter scam or the marines' case has linked the
   two, apart from the Italian government's role in both. The Italian
   government has a 30 per cent stake in Finmeccanica.

   The International Tribunal of the Law of the Seas, the apex UN court on
   conflicts involving maritime territorial disputes, told this newspaper
   its work on the case was done after it ordered India to stop legal
   proceedings against the marines till the arbitration court reaches a
   verdict.

   Italy had approached the international tribunal last year, contending
   that the marines shot the fishermen in international waters - and not
   in Indian waters as New Delhi has insisted. "The case has now moved
   completely to the PCA," a tribunal spokesperson said from Hamburg.
   "It's no longer with us."

   But the PCA, which has set up a tribunal under Russian lawyer Vladimir
   Golitsyn, the President of the international tribunal, to hear the
   marines' case at The Hague, is empowered to consider Michel's letter as
   a valid deposition in determining its verdict.

   Most third-party depositions the PCA receives are from states,
   international organisations or non-profit groups with technical
   expertise in the area of dispute. If an individual petitions the court,
   the tribunal has one of two options, the PCA Bureau - the court's
   secretariat - said in an email. It can explicitly detail the
   possibility of individual depositions in the "rules of procedure" for
   the case - but it need not.

   "Should these rules of procedure not provide for any express mechanism
   in this regard, it would fall to the arbitral tribunal to take a
   decision on the request to intervene," the PCA Bureau said.

   The tribunal, which takes decisions through a majority, has four
   arbitrators other than its chief - including one representative each
   nominated by India and Italy, and two lawyers picked by Golitsyn.

   India's nominee is P. Chandrasekhara Rao, a former secretary in the law
   ministry.

School sports fundraiser launched to raise $500K annually

   GRAND RAPIDS, MI – Grand Rapids Public Schools and the Student
   Advancement Foundation announced the launch of a community-wide
   fundraiser Tuesday, Feb. 9, designed to keep offering sports to
   students for free.

   The campaign, announced in the gym of the Martin Luther King Leadership
   Academy, will support a [223]GR8 Sports, Great Kids effort. The youth
   sports program ensures access to kindergarten through eighth-grade
   sports to all students, regardless of their families' ability to pay.

   Funding for GR8 Sports comes from a combination of community support
   and GRPS. By the 2018-19 school year, officials say community support
   will need to be at least $500,000 annually. GRPS would contribute
   $300,000.

   "So many school programs require students to 'pay to play' but in Grand
   Rapids we said that's not what we wanted," Superintendent Teresa
   Weatherall Neal told the parents, philanthropists and community leaders
   who gathered for the event.

   "The students' access to physical activities is critical to enhance
   their health and wellness. This impacts their ability to go to school,
   to focus, to study and ultimately, to learn.''

   SAF was created in 1993 to provide a channel for the community to
   contribute supplemental funds for GRPS activities and programs.

   Michele Suchovsky, executive director of the Grand Rapids Student
   Advancement Foundation, said for seven years the organization has
   worked with GRPS, first with providing funding for elementary sports,
   and later joining the Doug and Maria DeVos Foundation in supporting
   middle school programming.

   Suchovsky said a year ago, they formally named the initiative GR8
   Sports, Great Kids, and decided to hold a fundraiser to get the
   community invested to sustain and grow the program.

   "We use sports to empower kids to learn, develop and thrive,'' she
   said.

   a 4.0 GPA. Monica Scott MLive.com

   This school year, there are around 5,000 students engaged in 14
   after-school sports programs.

   Shay and Julio Mendez, who have five children at Gerald R. Ford
   Academic Center and Grand Rapids University Preparatory Academy
   (UPrep), said it would be very expensive if they had to pay for their
   children to participate in athletics.

   "Our children have always been really good in school but sports pushes
   them even more and gives them more of an opportunity for scholarships
   for both academics and sports," said Shay Mendez. "I am appreciative of
   the contributions that allow our kids to participate for free."

   The couple said they were moved by the remarks from Doug DeVos,
   co-founder of GR8 Sports, Great Kids.

   "When you put other activities into a child's life and you connect the
   community in a way such as this, you create opportunities," said DeVos,
   who said cost can be a huge barrier to students having a meaningful
   experience in life.

   DeVos told the students present they are worthy of investment and
   attention. He said the sky's the limit, if they are willing to work
   hard and challenge themselves.

   "You are vital," he said. "As a community we have high expectations for
   you. We want to create opportunities and eliminate barriers."

   The Mendezes' daughter, Dahlia Mendez, a seventh-grader at UPrep who
   plays multiple sports, addressed the crowd after DeVos. The city
   wrestling and cross country champion said sports are fun and teach
   teamwork and leadership skills.

   "I love sports because you get to bond with people," said Dahlia, a 4.0
   student.
   "The people you meet can become your best friends for life."

   K-5 sports currently offered in the program include: soccer, track and
   field, basketball and cross country. Sports for those in grades 6-8
   include: co-ed cross country, boys football, girls volleyball, boys and
   girls soccer, boys and girls basketball, boys wrestling, co-ed bowling,
   boys baseball, girls softball, co-ed competitive cheer, co-ed track and
   co-ed swim.

   Jolinda Lucas, athletic director for U Prep/ Grand Rapids
   Montessori/Museum School, said 43 percent (approximately 80 students)
   of UPrep's students participate in sports and the students involved
   average over a 3.0 GPA.

   Funding is also being sought for GR8 Girls, a subset of GR8 Sports,
   Great Kids.

   "Our goal is to positively promote and support girls' athletics within
   GRPS," said Cara Jones, director of GR8 Sports, Great Kids. "Just in
   the last year more than 2,000 girls participated in the program and we
   were able to provide the equipment, uniforms as well as coaching and
   transportation needs."

   Program officials are looking for volunteer coaches for all K-8 sports.
   They need coaches who can commit during the season to one or
   two-hour-long practices each week and a game or meet on Saturday.

   Those interested in the donating to the program or becoming a volunteer
   can find more information about GR8, Great Kids [225]online or by
   calling SAF at 616-988-5430.

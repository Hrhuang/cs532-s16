   visit [3]www.twitter.com (the "Website") to create an Account; creating
   an Account is free. By submitting your information and creating an
   Account, you will be required to agree to the Twitter terms of service
   and privacy policy. If you do not agree to Twitter's terms of service
   and privacy policy, you cannot create an Account or participate in this
   Sweepstakes. Once you have a public Twitter Account, to enter during
   the Sweepstakes Period,  eligible individuals can enter the Sweepstakes
   by "Retweeting" or "Quote Tweeting" any of the Tweets that @Esurance
   has posted throughout the Sweepstakes Period that include the hashtag
   #EsuranceSweepstakes or by Tweeting #EsuranceSweepstakes (an "Entry").
    Sponsor, in its sole discretion, may accept a technically incorrect
   hashtag.   If you choose to compose your own Tweet or "Quote Tweet" and
   include new content in the Quote Tweet, your Tweet must not contain
   material that violates or infringes another's rights, including, but
   not limited to privacy, publicity or intellectual property rights, or
   constitutes copyright infringement; not disparage Sponsor or any other
   person or party affiliated with the Sweepstakes; not promote any cause
   other than the Sweepstakes' theme; not contain material that is
   inappropriate, indecent, lewd, pornographic, obscene, hateful,
   tortious, defamatory, slanderous or libelous (as determined by Sponsor,
   at Sponsor's sole discretion); and not contain, facilitate, reference
   or use material that promotes bigotry, racism, hatred or harm against
   any group or individual or promotes discrimination based on race,
   gender, ethnicity, religion, nationality, disability, sexual
   orientation, political orientation, citizenship, ancestry, marital
   status or age (as determined by Sponsor, at Sponsor's sole discretion)
   (all of the foregoing prohibited material is "Ineligible Content").
   Sponsor reserves the right to remove, reject or disqualify (along with
   the entrants who submitted them) any Entry which, in its opinion
   violate any of these Official Rules, includes any Ineligible Content or
   are otherwise inappropriate for inclusion in the Sweepstakes. Sponsor
   also reserves the right to remove, reject or disqualify (along with the
   entrants who submitted them) any Entry which is sent from an Account
   (including, but not limited to, the username or handle of that Account)
   that, in its opinion, violates any of these Official Rules, includes
   any Ineligible Content or is otherwise inappropriate for inclusion in
   the Sweepstakes.  For purposes of this Sweepstakes, only Entries
   received by Sponsor will be considered. Proof of submission of an Entry
   (such as a printed or copied screenshot or message) does not constitute
   proof of actual receipt of the Entry for purposes of this Sweepstakes.
   The Twitter database clock will be the official timekeeper for this
   Sweepstakes; provided, however, that the end times for certain entry
   periods during the Sweepstakes will be determined as described in
   Section 4 below. NOTE: Sponsor may not receive entries from Twitter
   users with "protected" updates (i.e., user has set the Account so that
   only people the user has approved can view updates) due to the way
   Twitter operates its service. Tweets not received by Sponsor will not
   be entered into the Sweepstakes.  A person cannot win more than one
   prize in the Sweepstakes; any person selected as a potential winner in
   an Entry Period will be disqualified from entering in the remaining
   Entry Periods.  Multiple entrants are not permitted to share the same
   Twitter Account. Attempts made by an individual to submit Entries in
   violation of these Official Rules by using multiple Accounts or false
   contact information or otherwise may be disqualified. Entries that are
   generated by a macro, bot, or other automated means will not be
   accepted and will be void.  Entries made by any other individual or any
   entity or group, or originating at any web site other than as set forth
   specifically above, including, without limitation, through commercial
   sweepstakes subscription notification or entering services, will be
   declared invalid and disqualified for this Sweepstakes. As a condition
   of entering the Sweepstakes, without limiting any other provision in
   these Official Rules, each entrant gives consent for Sponsor and its
   agents to obtain and deliver his or her name, address and other
   information to third parties, including all information submitted
   through the Affidavit and Tax Document, for the purpose of
   administering this Sweepstakes and complying with applicable laws,
   regulations, and rules. Such third parties may use your information for
   their own independent purposes in accordance with their own independent
   privacy practices. Except as otherwise contemplated in these Official
   Rules, Sponsor will use personal information collected in connection
   with the Sweepstakes in accordance with its online privacy policy,
   located at https://www.esurance.com/legal/privacy-policy.

   NOTE ABOUT TWITTER: Sweepstakes Entities are not responsible for any
   changes to or unavailability of the Twitter service that may interfere
   with the Sweepstakes (including any limitations, any restrictions, or
   any conditions on Sponsor's ability to use Twitter for the Sweepstakes
   as set forth herein that are not acceptable to Sponsor) or ability of
   entrant to timely enter, receive notices or communicate with Sponsor
   via Twitter, in which case Sponsor, in its sole discretion, may
   terminate or modify the Sweepstakes. It is a potential winner's
   responsibility to set his/her Account to accept Twitter Direct Messages
   by Sponsor and/or Follow @Esurance to receive Twitter Direct Messages
   by Sponsor and to timely check his/her Account for any Twitter Direct
   Messages from Sponsor to receive and therefore claim a prize.

4. Prize Winner Selection & Notification:

   Sponsor shall select winners by random drawing from all eligible
   Entries received during each Entry Period according to the chart below.
   The Sweepstakes will coincide with a nationally televised championship
   football game being played on 2/7/16, before and after which Esurance
   will air television commercials promoting the Sweepstakes. Entries will
   be collected throughout the Sweepstakes Period. As further described
   under Prize/Odds below, one drawing will be conducted from Entries
   collected during each of the four In-Game Entry Periods as well as the
   Post-Game Entry Period, for a total of five drawings. The In-Game Entry
   Periods together with the Post-Game Entry Period collectively may be
   referred to herein as the "Entry Periods", and individually each an
   "Entry Period". Each Entry Period will begin at the start of the
   Sweepstakes Period and end at one of the following times: (i) at the
   start of the first quarter of the football game, (ii) at the start of
   the second quarter of the football game, (iii) at the start of the
   third quarter of the football game, (iv) at the start of the fourth
   quarter of the football game, or(v) at 11:59 PM PT on 2/8/16. Because
   the timing of the start of the various quarters of the football game is
   variable and cannot be determined exactly in advance, the timing of the
   Entry Periods will depend on how the game progresses. The end times for
   all In-Game Entry Periods will occur as reflected by the game clock on
   the live national television broadcast of the football game. For
   example, the "start of the first quarter" will occur when the game
   clock begins to count down from the start of the game.   An otherwise
   qualifying Entry which is not selected as a potential winner during a
   given Entry Period will be considered as an Entry during subsequent
   Entry Periods.

   Each drawing will be conducted by a Sponsor designee, whose decisions
   regarding the random drawing will be final. The drawings for the
   In-Game Entry Periods will occur approximately 15 minutes after the end
   of each In-Game Entry Period. The drawing for the Post-Game Entry
   Period will occur at approximately 8:00 AM PT on 2/9/16. Each potential
   winner will be notified that he/she may have won a prize by Twitter
   Direct Message (an "Unofficial Winner Notification") to the Twitter
   Account from which the applicable Entry was tweeted within two (2)
   hours of the end of the applicable Entry Period.  If the Sponsor is
   unable to contact a potential winner by Twitter Direct Message, the
   Sponsor may, in its sole discretion, send a public Tweet to the
   potential winner. To claim a prize, the potential winner must follow
   the directions in his or her Unofficial Winner Notification.  Included
   in the Unofficial Winner Notification will be a link to an online
   "redemption portal" where each potential winner will be required to
   login using the "Verification Pin" code provided in the Unofficial
   Winner Notification and register to redeem the applicable prize by
   entering the following information: email address, his/her complete
   first and last name, street address (no P.O. Boxes), city, state, ZIP
   Code, telephone number, mobile phone number, date of birth, and two
   questions relating to how they would like to be communicated with, and
   by click the box stating that he/she agrees to these Official Rules.
   Each potential winner must complete the prize claim process on the
   redemption portal or reply to the message via Direct Message to
   @Esurance no later than 11:59:59 PM  PT on 2/7/16 for potential winners
   of the In-Game Entry Periods and 11:59:59 PM PT on 2/9/16 for the
   potential winner of the Post-Game Entry Period. Except where prohibited
   by law, as a condition of winning a prize in the Sweepstakes, Sponsor
   will require each potential winner to complete, execute, have
   potentially notarized and return an Affidavit of Eligibility, Mutually
   Agreeable Liability Release, and a Publicity Release, (collectively,
   the "Affidavit") and any required Tax Documents (e.g., Form 1099) by
   10:00:00 AM PT on 2/8/16 for potential winners of the In-Game Entry
   Periods and 10:00:00 AM PT on 2/10/16 for the potential winner of the
   Post-Game Entry Period, or as otherwise requested by Sponsor. Each
   potential winner will be required to provide his or her Social Security
   Number or other applicable tax ID number for tax purposes. In the event
   of noncompliance with these requirements, the prize may be forfeited in
   Sponsor's sole discretion, awarded to an alternative winner selected at
   random from the pool of eligible entrants,  or go unclaimed and
   unawarded. The Affidavit is subject to verification by Sponsor.

   If any Unofficial Winner Notification or other Sweepstakes
   communication is rejected or returned as undeliverable, if a potential
   winner cannot be reached after a reasonable attempt has been made by
   Sponsor (as determined by Sponsor in its sole discretion), if the
   winner cannot receive the prize, if a potential winner fails to comply
   with these Official Rules, or if a potential winner fails to respond to
   a Unofficial Winner Notification and/or to sign and return the
   Affidavit within the time periods set forth herein, that potential
   winner's prize will be forfeited in Sponsor's sole discretion. An
   alternate winner may be selected based on the original method of winner
   selection in Sponsor's sole discretion. Sponsor may only look to two
   (2) alternate winners, at which point the prize may be deemed unclaimed
   and Sponsor will have no further obligation with respect to the prize.
    Sponsor reserves the right to modify the notification procedures in
   connection with the selection of any potential winner. If legitimately
   claimed in compliance with these Official Rules, each prize will be
   awarded. Upon prize forfeiture, no compensation will be given and
   Sponsor will have no responsibility or liability to that participant.
   The winner will be issued an IRS 1099 Tax Form for the stated value of
   the prize in January, 2017 following the receipt of prize. After a
   potential winner is verified as an official winner in the sole
   discretion of the Sponsor the official winner may be notified live at
   the contact information provided to the Sponsor on the Affidavit.

5. Prize / Odds:

   There will be sixteen (16) "First Prize" giveaways of $50,000 each,
   with First Prize Winners to be selected in a series of four (4) random

   $250,000, with the Grand Prize Winner to be selected by a random

   discretion. Prize winners will also have the opportunity to potentially
   participate in a televised "Official Winner Notification" which could
   be shown on television and via other media at the sole discretion of
   the Sponsor. Total Approximate Retail Value ("ARV") of all prizes is
   $1,050,000.

   Odds of winning depend upon number of eligible entries received. Each
   prize winner will still be solely responsible for all taxes and other
   expenses related to the prize. Prize winners waive the right to assert
   as a cost of winning any prize, any and all costs of verification and
   redemption and any liability and publicity which might arise from
   claiming or seeking to claim said prize.  Sponsor will not replace any
   lost, mutilated or stolen prize or any prize that is undeliverable or
   does not reach a winner because of an incorrect or changed address. No
   transfers or prize substitutions will be made, except at Sponsor's sole
   discretion. No more than the stated prize will be awarded. In no event
   will more prizes be awarded than are stated in these Official Rules. In
   the event that, due to technical, typographical, mechanical or other
   errors, there are more winners than are stated in these Official Rules,
   a random drawing among the claimants will be held to determine the
   actual winners.

10. General Rules:

   Sponsor's failure to enforce any term of these Official Rules shall not
   constitute a waiver of that provision.  Sponsor's decisions will be
   final in all matters relating to this Sweepstakes, including
   interpretation of these Official Rules and awarding of the prize.
   Participants further agree to not damage or cause interruption of the
   Sweepstakes and/or prevent others from using the Sweepstakes. Sponsor
   reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to void entries of any
   entrants who Sponsor believes have attempted to tamper with or impair
   the administration, security, fairness or proper play of this
   Sweepstakes. Sponsor's failure to or decision not to enforce any
   provision in these Official Rules will not constitute a waiver of that
   or any other provision. In the event there is an alleged or actual
   ambiguity, discrepancy or inconsistency between disclosures or other
   statements contained in any Sweepstakes-related materials and/or these
   Official Rules (including any alleged discrepancy or inconsistency in
   these Official Rules), it will be resolved in Sponsor's sole
   discretion. Entrants waive any right to claim ambiguity in the
   Sweepstakes or these Official Rules. If Sponsor determines at any time
   in its sole discretion that the prize winner or potential prize winner
   is disqualified, ineligible, or in violation of these Official Rules,
   or engaging in behavior that Sponsor deems obnoxious, inappropriate,
   threatening, illegal or that is intended to annoy, abuse, threaten or
   harass any other person, Sponsor reserves the right in its sole
   discretion to select an alternate winner, even if the disqualified
   potential Grand Prize Winner's name or other information or content may
   have been shown or announced on the Web Site or elsewhere. In the event
   that any provision is determined to be invalid or otherwise
   unenforceable or illegal, these Official Rules will otherwise remain in
   effect and will be construed in accordance with their terms as if the
   invalid or illegal provision were not contained herein. If the
   Sweepstakes is not capable of running as planned for any reason,
   Sponsor reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to cancel, modify
   or suspend the Sweepstakes and award the prize from eligible entries
   received prior to cancellation, modification, or suspension or as

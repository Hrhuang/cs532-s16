Episode Description

   The buzz: The times they are a-changin’. Yes! Social Media has not
   merely changed the way we buy – but also the way companies sell.
   Established businesses around the world are aware that they must get
   smarter about Social Sales in order to stay ahead of the competitive
   curve. But according to Adweek, 61% of Fortune 500 CEOs still have no
   Social Media presence. Why not? What are the implications for
   slow-to-adopt / slow-to-adapt companies and executives, as Social
   Selling continues to dramatically change the large enterprise? The
   experts speak. Maggie Fox, SAP: “Fortuna audaces Iuvat" or "Fortune
   favours the bold” (Latin proverb). Chris Boudreaux, EY: “Leaders grasp
   nettles” (David Ogilvy). Kirsten Boileau, SAP: “Your success in life
   isn't based on your ability to simply change. It is based on your
   ability to change faster than your competition, customers and business"
   (Mark Sanborn). Join us for How Social Selling Is Changing the Large
   Enterprise.

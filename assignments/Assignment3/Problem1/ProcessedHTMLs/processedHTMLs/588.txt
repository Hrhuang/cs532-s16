   The [129]Sacramento Kings, in a dramatic about-face, have decided
   against firing coach George Karl after a meeting Tuesday between Karl
   and general manager Vlade Divac, according to league sources.

   Sources told ESPN that, after Karl pledged to make some changes to
   address growing concerns within the organization about his defensive
   schemes and practice policies, Divac has decided to back the embattled
   coach.

   ESPN reported Monday night that the [130]Kings had decided to fire Karl
   during the forthcoming All-Star break. After what one source described
   as "in-depth discussions" Tuesday in Philadelphia to talk through the
   problems that have plagued the team during its current 1-8 funk, Divac
   told Karl that he has management's backing.

   "George will remain our coach and we're collectively working through
   our issues," Divac said in a statement.
   [stein_marc_m.jpg&w=80&h=80&scale=crop] Kings GM Vlade Divac opted
   against firing George Karl after meeting with the coach Tuesday over
   concerns plaguing the team, sources told ESPN. Rocky Widner/Getty
   Images

   The Kings are 21-31 and trail Utah by five games for the eighth and
   final postseason spot in the Western Conference.

   Sources told ESPN on Monday night that rising dismay, both within the
   front office and among players, with Karl's defensive schemes, practice
   policies and general leadership have had a demoralizing effect on the
   team, which dropped eight of nine games in the wake of a recent
   five-game winning streak that briefly had Sacramento in the West's
   eighth playoff spot.

   Karl is the Kings' eighth coach since the start of the 2006-07 season,
   which began a playoff drought that's up to nine seasons and counting.

   Sources told ESPN on Monday that Vivek Ranadive, who took ownership of
   the Kings in May 2013, left the decision on whether to fire or retain
   Karl with Divac. The owner has twice bucked NBA convention by hiring a
   coach -- first Mike Malone, then Karl -- before hiring his GM.

   Divac wasn't installed as the Kings' lead decision-maker until after
   Karl was hired in February 2015. He replaced Pete D'Alessandro as Kings
   GM after Malone was ousted in December 2014.

   Karl has an estimated $10 million in guaranteed money left on his
   original four-year, $15 million contract with the Kings. He nearly lost
   his job in November after a much-publicized blowup with center
   [131]DeMarcus Cousins, but one source insisted Monday that the November
   dispute was "the result of frustration over a lack of coaching."

   USA Today reported Tuesday afternoon that some of Ranadive's minority
   partners, because of the significant amount money still owed Karl,
   would also likely have a say in whether Karl stays or goes.

   A controlled burn of brilliance
   By [52]Ryan McCaffrey

   These days I tend to enjoy games that are similar to a good book: a
   solitary, escapist experience I can get completely lost in without any
   interruptions from the outside world. [53]Firewatch, then – on the
   strength of its gripping story, brilliant branching script, wholly
   convincing voice-acting performances, and stunning art direction – is
   easily one of my favorite and most memorable game experiences of this
   decade.

   Firewatch quickly lets you know that it’s not going to pull any
   emotional punches over its four to five–hour runtime, opening with a
   series of text-based choices that call back to adventure genre
   forebears like Zork. I dare not spoil this potent sequence, but I will
   say that it masterfully bounces between being funny and heart-wrenching
   and plausibly establishes just why protagonist Henry ends up in the
   Wyoming woods as a solitary fire lookout.

   Morning Glory

   “

   The Two Forks Woods sticks in my mind like a real place.

   Once you arrive there, Firewatch’s powerful ambiance takes hold. The
   story takes place over the course of an entire summer, with different
   “days” – which are treated as chapters of the story – playing out at
   different hours of the day and night. That allows bold reds, yellows,
   and oranges to color this fictional Wyoming forest’s beautifully
   painted scenery (a contribution by renowned illustrator Olly Moss) –
   all in a comfortable and immersive first-person perspective. It is a
   testament to both Moss and Firewatch’s level designers that, even
   despite the stylized look, the Two Forks Woods sticks in my mind like a
   real place: the narrow passage through Thunder Canyon, the serene calm
   of Jonesy Lake, the comically small size of Pork Pond, and the
   unexplained mystery of the Medicine Wheel. In fact, only the strange
   absence of almost any wildlife whatsoever betrays the convincing
   setting.

   Firewatch sounds as good as it looks, thanks to a world-class script
   acted to perfection by its two leads. Rookie lookout Henry is given a
   playful vulnerability; you can choose to play him serious or funny, and
   the performance is up to the task either way. Henry’s boss – and
   primary point of human contact for the entire summer – is Delilah. Her
   emotional armor is thick, and she shows the cracks in her personality
   we’re allowed to see as we play without resorting to being
   overdramatic.

   “

   It’s tense, scary, and funny – sometimes all within a few minutes of
   each other

   Right from the jump, their relationship feels real, despite the fact
   that they’re communicating entirely via radio, with no faces on screen
   to lend emotional cues. Henry – or Hank, as she sometimes defiantly
   calls him – comes across as a good man at heart, but a flawed one – a
   man not sure about whether or not to go back to the life he left behind
   in Boulder, Colorado. He is fully capable of matching wits with
   Delilah, who uses humor as a shield for the personal life she doesn’t
   like discussing as they get to know each other over the course of the
   summer.

   It’s a pair of firework-launching teenage girls that set Firewatch’s
   story in motion, and you can choose to talk to Delilah at almost any
   time by bringing up your two-way radio. She’s got something to say
   about almost everything, whether you need advice on how to handle a
   given situation or you’re just reporting your progress on a task she’s
   given you, and she’s so engaging that I found myself eager to call
   about every little thing I came across. Things get darker – in a
   figurative as well as a sometimes literal sense – when the teens go
   missing, and you and Delilah try to piece together the puzzle of their
   whereabouts while making your own critical (sometimes difficult)
   decisions. The writing here is simply head and shoulders above nearly
   every other game I’ve ever played. In fact, Firewatch’s script, unlike
   most video games, would also make a fantastic novella that’s every bit
   as gripping as the game is. It’s tense, scary, and funny – sometimes
   all within a few minutes of each other. Not a lot of games can
   successfully claim that.

   Above: 17 minutes of Firewatch gameplay (SPOILER WARNING)

   “

   There were points where I was afraid to turn around in the vast, lonely
   woods.

   Like other so-called “walking simulators,” the gameplay in Firewatch is
   the story, though at least there’s more to actually do here than in
   most games within the genre. A substantial swath of Two Forks Woods is
   explorable, with supply caches, unique sights, and even a hidden turtle
   you can adopt (you’re gonna live with me now, Shelly Duvall!). You’ll
   rappel down cliffsides, climb up rock formations, explore the lookout
   tower that doubles as your home for the summer, and more. And yet,
   these same simple actions that are a delightful exploration of your new
   surroundings at the beginning of the game become almost terrifying as
   the plot progresses, leading to points where, playing in Henry’s
   first-person perspective, I was afraid to turn around in the vast,
   lonely woods.

   Speaking of navigation: though I’m thankful there’s no giant arrow at
   the top of the screen pointing me exactly to where I need to go at any
   given moment, I did find getting around the Two Forks Woods a bit
   cumbersome at times, particularly near the end. While I was never hung
   up for too long, translating the map to the actual trail in front of
   you had me occasionally taking a wrong fork in the path. Henry’s
   compass helps a lot, however, so I was never hung up for too long.

   As for the ending, it’s the only other part of Firewatch I wasn’t crazy
   about. I want to be very careful not to spoil anything, so I’ll just
   say that I didn’t quite find the revelation I had hoped for when I
   reached the end of what the story had been building up to. At the same
   time, however, I didn’t dislike the ending either. In fact, I find
   myself still thinking about it, trying to think of missed clues or
   other small cues that might yet give me the “Ah-ha!” moment I’m after.
   I’ll be very interested to hear other people’s take on the conclusion –
   this is the kind of game where the discussions that will arise
   afterwards are an important extension of the experience itself.
   The Verdict

   [57]Firewatch is amazing for many reasons, but above all because it’s
   an adult game that deals with serious issues, with realistic adult
   dialogue to match. And it deals with those issues just like actual
   adults would: sometimes with humor, sometimes with anger, and sometimes
   with sadness. It is among the very best of the first-person narrative
   genre, and it reminds us what video game storytelling is capable of in
   the right hands. It’s a game I can see coming back to every year or two
   just to revisit its beautiful sights and memorable characters – just
   like a good book.

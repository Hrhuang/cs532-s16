   Niagara This Week - St. Catharines
   By [100]Matt Young

   HAMILTON—The Niagara IceDogs (26-18-3-3) begin the action this week
   with an unusual 10:30 a.m. puck drop at First Ontario Centre on
   Wednesday where they will visit the Bulldogs (19-27-5-0) in front of
   thousands of school children.

   The Bulldogs are expecting more than 13,000 students from Grades 4-6.

   Hamilton defeated Niagara 5-2 at the Meridian Centre in St. Catharines
   in their last meeting.

   In a league typically dominated by the home team, the road team has
   managed to win each game in the series this season; a trend the IceDogs
   hope to continue on Wednesday morning.

   Hamilton leads the series 2-1.

   Goaltender Connor Hicks has dominant the IceDogs this season by posting
   a .924 save percentage.

   In their last meeting, Hicks stole the game for Hamilton with 47 saves.

   Welland’s Niki Petti has elevated his game versus the IceDogs.

   Petti notched a goal and two assists against Niagara and was the best
   player on the ice aside from Hicks.

   He has five points in the three games versus Niagara.

   Niagara will also need to generate traffic in front of the Hamilton
   goal in this game as Hicks has proven he is capable of stifling Niagara
   shooters when he is able to see the puck.

   Hamilton is on the verge of capturing the last playoff spot in the
   Eastern Conference.

   Niagara travels to London to face the Knights (36-11-2-1) on Friday at
   Budweiser Gardens.

   In their only meeting of the season, Niagara defeated London 3-2.

   It will have only been a week since these two teams squared off, and
   some bad blood may exist from the last game with Matthew Tkachuk
   slashing Jordan Maletta as the horn blew to end the game. Maletta
   wasn’t seriously hurt on the play, yet it was the type of move that
   should result in suspension.

   The key to this game will be for the IceDogs to stay out of the penalty
   box. London has a lot of offensive weapons at their disposal and it is
   unlikely the IceDogs can win another game that has London on the power
   play eight times. Niagara must play disciplined, physical hockey
   against the Knights to capture these two big points in the standings.

   Toronto Maple Leafs’ prospect Mitch Marner picked up an assist in last
   week’s game, but was relatively invisible throughout the game due to an
   equipment issue. Marner has 82 points in just 39 games this season and
   will play a significantly bigger role in this week’s re-match with
   Niagara.

   While Marner attracts most of the headlines by virtue of being Maple
   Leafs property, Christian Dvorak was once again the best Knight on the
   ice last week.

   Dvorak scored one of London’s two goals on the power play and now has
   40 goals in 41 games this season.

   Dvorak is on pace for 128 points this season which would crush his
   career high of 109 set last season playing with fellow Arizona Coyotes
   rookie Max Domi.

   London rebounded with a pair of victories to close out the weekend.

   Although the Knights play in the Western Conference, the IceDogs always
   seem to get up for games against head coach Dale Hunter.

   The IceDogs have a three-game winning streak against London (dating
   back to last season), and you can bet the Knights will want to end that
   losing streak in front of their home fans this week.

   This has the makings of a great game on paper, however the IceDogs need
   to keep their emotions in check and avoid the frustration they
   encountered last week.

   The IceDogs close out the week by playing the Mississauga Steelheads
   (25-24-1-3) at the Meridian Centre on Sunday afternoon in a Valentine’s
   Day matinee.

   While the details are sketchy, the IceDogs are promising “that history
   will be made during the second intermission of this game.”

   While we have no idea what this means, it should give fans another
   reason to attend this game against their division rival.

   In their last meeting, Steelheads goaltender Jack Flinn shutout the
   IceDogs at the Hershey Centre; a 5-0 thrashing back on Jan. 22.

   Flinn’s shutout in that game was his league-leading seventh of the
   season, and was the latest display of his stellar play against Niagara
   this season.

   Flinn has a .922 save percentage against the IceDogs this season, and
   his play in goal has been a difference-maker for Mississauga in their
   four contests.

   Alexander Nylander and Michael McLeod are both eligible for the 2017
   NHL Entry Draft, and both have turned in dominant performances against
   Niagara this season.

   Nylander has scored four goals and added four assists in four games
   against Niagara, while McLeod has six points of his own over the
   stretch.

   The key to the game for Niagara will be finding a way to stop the
   Steelheads’ dynamic duo, something the rest of the league has yet to
   do.

   Nylander’s 61 points leads all OHL rookies and has him sitting 15th
   overall in league scoring, while McLeod sits 20th with 56 points.

   Marty Williamson will likely want to use the strategy they utilize
   against the Knights when they play Mississauga on Sunday.

   The IceDogs will want to beat Mississauga’s offensive stars to their
   blue line in order to avoid giving them any additional time and space
   in the Niagara zone.

   If the IceDogs manage to use this strategy and the benefit of having
   the last change to their advantage, they should send the Meridian
   Centre faithful home happy this Sunday.

   With only 18 games left in the season, the IceDogs must continue to win
   the majority of their games as they compete for a home-ice advantage in
   the playoffs.

   There are only four points separating the third place and seventh place
   teams in the East, so every game is important as the season comes to a
   close.

   This Week’s Prediction: The IceDogs will capture four of six points to
   make it back-to-back winning weekends.

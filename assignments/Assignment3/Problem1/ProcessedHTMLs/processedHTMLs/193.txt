   [62]Dying Light: The Following is Great. Get it 20% Off.

   The Following adds vehicle action to this open-world, parkour infused
   zombie shooter. We gave it an 8.8, and if you have [63]Amazon Prime,
   you can [64]get the game for $48 instead of the full $60. Add it your

   [66]Pick A Free Game and Get a $75 Gift Card with Any Xbox One

   Today at the [67]Microsoft Store we have one of the better Xbox One
   deals I've seen in a while, mainly because you can pick your Xbox One
   bundle while scoring $75 in Microsoft Store credit and a bonus free
   game. It's pretty common to see a $50 discount on the Xbox One, so I'd
   say $75 in credit and a free game beats that, especially since the Xbox
   One Elite console is eligible.

   My favorite bundles from this deal:
     * [68]Xbox One 1TB Holiday Bundle - 1TB system and you get downloads
       of Gears of War: Ultimate Edition, Rare Replay, and Ori and the
       Blind Forest.
     * [69]Xbox One 500GB Name Your Game Bundle - a 500GB system with
       choice of Forza Motorsport 6, Rise of the Tomb Raider, Gears of
       War: Ultimate Edition, or Rare Replay.
     * [70]Xbox One Elite Bundle - system with 1TB hybrid solid state
       drive plus it includes that $150 Elite controller.

   617jv5Fl32L._SL1252_

   [71]Want a White Xbox One? They're [DEL: $20 :DEL]  $50 Off

   Update: [72]Walmart actually has it for even less.

   There's not gift card, but it includes Gears, and if you're partial to
   a while One, you can get one at a [73]$20 discount from Amazon right
   now.

   [77]A 7-inch Kindle Fire is Only $40 Right Now

   Amazon's Kindle Fire tablets are great ways to watch Netflix, Prime
   Video, or read digital comics. They're not as full featured as an iPad
   or Android tablet, but as far as a dirt cheap way to consume media, $40
   for a 7-inch tablet can't be beat. This is the cheapest Kindle Fire
   I've seen since Black Friday.

   61tpxOYuK4L._SL1000_

   [78]A Pair of Aviators for $11

   ZeroUV makes some of the best cheap sunglasses around. They're 100% UVA
   protective, they come with a pouch, and at $11, you're not gonna be too
   mad if you break them or leave them in a cab. I keep a pair
   of [79]their RayBan knockoffs (which are also only $11) in my glove
   compartment and I definitely recommend them.

   71TK4W016xL._UY500_

   about $2,000 for this laptop if you bought it from Apple, but you

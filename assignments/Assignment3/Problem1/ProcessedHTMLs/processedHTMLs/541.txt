   LeBron James on Chris Bosh: "There's nothing really I can say to make
   things better for him. I texted him today and told him I was sorry and
   I hate that he has to go through this again. Guy means so much to not
   only the Heat family but his personal family as well. Just a great guy,
   a professional, a great guy and for something like this to happen to
   him after he was cleared, it just sucks. It sucks big time. His health
   is the No. 1 care and obviously basketball comes secondary to what he's
   going through right now. It's just tough."

   believe in his system, I believe in a lot of things, it just takes
   time. It just takes guys being healthy and willing to muster up things.
   We've proven that we can beat the good teams in this league. But we
   have to be a lot more cautious and be able to muster up wins in
   consecutive games. We always beat the good teams and lose to the bad
   teams. But like I told him before the All-Star break and we were
   texting back and forth, I said, I believe in you, Coach. I appreciate

   because we got a lot of young guys too. In previous years we [were]
   able to muster up because we had guys that had been together for a
   while, we had a good belief system. But it's a little different, we got
   different guys, and it's different. You're a veteran now. It's not like
   you're the young guys on the curb anymore so it's frustrating but I

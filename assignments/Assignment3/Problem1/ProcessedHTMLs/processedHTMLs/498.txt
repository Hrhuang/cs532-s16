Cover Reveal - Double Up by Vanessa North

Cover & Excerpt Reveal

                         Double Up by Vanessa North

   [14]Double Up Knowing he’s loved can make any man fly.
   Fifteen years ago, Ben Warren was a wakeboarding champion: king of big
   air, ballsy tricks, and boned grabs. Until a career-ending injury left
   him broken in ways he still has no hope of fixing. Now he takes his
   thrills where he can get them, and tries not to let life hurt too much.
   Then Davis Fox arrives in Ben’s sporting goods store with a plan to get
   in touch with his estranged brother by competing in the annual
   wakeboarding double-up contest. The catch? He’s never ridden before.
   It’s crazy, but Ben’s a sucker for the guy’s sob story—and for his
   dimples, too—so he agrees to coach Davis.
   Davis is everything Ben isn’t: successful, confident, and in love with
   life. And he wants Ben to love life—and him—too. But before Ben can
   embrace a future with Davis, he needs to remember how to hope.

   Excerpt:
   I know his type the minute he walks through the door.
   He’s at least twenty-five, has more money than God, and recently
   decided his dick is measured by the air he can catch on a board. He’s
   wearing khakis and a polo shirt, as if he came from a golf course. Or
   work. Do guys like him work? Or just milk a trust fund?
   He’s also cute. Really fucking cute. Dark hair, freckles, dimples, a
   lean body. I can’t help but take an interest. Or my cock can’t.
   But I know better. He’s probably straight, and even if he isn’t, he’s
   way the fuck out of my league. The guy has eyelashes for days and that
   mouth? Holy hell. Get it together, Warren.
   “Welcome to Legend Wakeboards. Can I help you?”
   “Yeah . . . I need to see Ben Warren.” He looks down at a card in his
   hand—likely from the boat dealership that occupies most of the
   building—then back at me. “I want to talk about some private lessons.”
   Of course you do.
   “Well, I’m Ben.” I flash my the-cash-register-made-me-do-it smile.
   “What can I do for you?” It’s pretty typical: these guys make some
   money midtwenties, when they aren’t too old to show their asses at
   extreme sports. Guys like him think it’s going to be easy. Then, you
   get them on the water, they get frustrated, and somehow it’s your fault
   they can’t ride. They’re all wallet, no action. I should know: I got
   into this gig because I had something to prove to guys like him.
   Even with sponsors, my wallet wasn’t very big, but I showed my ass all
   right. We sell the video. For three years running, I was the reigning
   champion of the Lake Lovelace Tournament and Double-Up Contest. I was
   no slouch on the pro circuit either; I even won an X Games medal. That
   was fifteen years ago. Now I teach lessons and summer camp and hardly
   ride at all—only when I have to demonstrate something during a lesson.
   I miss it, sure, but mostly I’m content to sit behind the counter at
   the world’s smallest pro shop, and sell boards to guys with more money
   than brains. Unless they’re cute. Then I just want them the hell out of
   my shop before they can remind me that no one wants a washed-up old
   has-been.
   He leans on the counter and flashes me a dimpled smile. The effect
   ricochets right off my brain and down to parts south.
   “So you’re the legend himself?”
   Why did I let Eddie name the shop? “Yeah, that’s me.”
   “Okay, so my kid brother is practically a fish. Born and raised on the
   lake. There’s talk of him going pro and he’s only thirteen.”
   Oh. A pang of disappointment surprises me. “If he’s that good, I don’t
   know that I have anything to teach him. What’s his name?”
   “Ridley Romeo.”
   Oh shit. Yeah, his kid brother is that good. He hits a double-up and he
   flies. He doesn’t just get big air, he makes his tricks beautiful, not
   to mention just plain sick. The kid is all balls, no bones.
   “You’re Ridley Romeo’s brother?” They don’t look alike. Granted,
   there’s at least ten years between them, and I’ve never seen the Romeo
   kid up close, but Ridley is blond haired.
   “Yeah. I’m Davis Fox. You can call me Dave.” He glances down at the
   card again, tucks it into his pocket, and extends his hand for a shake.
   “Riddles is my half brother. We’re not close—I just moved here from
   Charleston. But the lessons aren’t for him. They’re for me. I figure if
   I can do this double-up contest thing, maybe he and I could spend some
   time together and get to know each other a bit.”
   “Hold on. You want to enter the double-up contest?”
   He nods, flashing that smile again.
   “Have you ever ridden before?”
   He shakes his head.
   “You’re fucking nuts.” Yeah, it’s not polite to cuss at the customers,
   but seriously? “Look, I know you want to impress your kid brother, and
   you think it’s just water, how bad can the crash hurt? But it fucking
   hurts. People are fragile.” I’m fragile. I point to him. “You’re
   fragile.”
   “I’m tougher than I look.” Dimples. Is he flirting?
   “Not that tough. There’s got to be a better way to bond with your
   brother than entering a contest in an extreme sport you’ve never tried
   before.”
   The dimples disappear. “I’m not allowed to see him.” He looks down at
   his feet. “My stepfather doesn’t want a ‘dumb fucking faggot’ around
   his kid.”
   Ouch.

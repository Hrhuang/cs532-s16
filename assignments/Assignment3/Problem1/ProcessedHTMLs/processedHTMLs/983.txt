Rebuttal: Concussion Risks in Youth Sports Hardly Minimal

   Based on the latest science, and thousands of brain scans, Dr. Theodore
   Henderson and Dr. Larry Morries rebut a recent Denver Post column that
   may mislead parents, athletes and doctors.
   [126]concussion brain scan, spect, concussion, tbi [127]Actual brain
   images measuring blood flow and activity using SPECT (single photon
   emission computed tomography). Green and blue areas show injured areas
   due to concussions (traumatic brain injuries). *

   ([128]Newswire.net -- February 4, 2016) Lakewood, Colorado --Dr.
   Michael Kirkwood, neuropsychologist at The Children’s Hospital in
   Denver, Colorado recently opined that there was an exaggerated concern
   about concussions, that the movie, “Concussion” had sensationalized a
   benign malady, for which the “the vast majority recover
   completely”  (Denver Post, Sunday January 24, 2016). While his
   commentary purports to help distinguish scientifically valid
   information from bunk, his overarching message is, indeed, bunk.

   Concussions are traumatic brain injuries (TBIs). Brain injuries do not
   simply go away. Neuroimaging reveals evidence of persistent altered
   brain function years after a single concussion. A study of nearly 5,000
   adolescents across Ontario (Ilie et al., 2014) has shown that
   adolescents who have sustained a concussion were at significantly
   greater risk of psychological distress, suicide attempts, later
   requiring psychiatric medications for anxiety, depression or both, as
   well as being victimized through bullying or cyber-bullying.

   Concussions account for more than 15% of all high school sports-related
   injuries. The likelihood of a concussion in contact sport is estimated
   to be 19% per season-almost 1 out of every 5 athletes. The Centers for
   Disease Control recently declared sport concussions are reaching
   “epidemic levels” and deserve further research. A current patient of
   ours suffered a severe concussion, while kickboxing in college.
   Afterwards, she could not think clearly. As a result, she could not
   complete her PhD. Ultimately, she accrued some ½+ million dollars in
   health care cost with only a limited response to all the treatments.
   She had to file Chapter 7.

   Dr. Kirkwood’s own research provides further evidence this problem is
   hardly trivial. He and colleagues (Grubenhoff et al., 2015), reported
   that more than 20% of children visiting emergency rooms for concussion
   experienced persistent symptoms after a concussion. Moreover, 12% had
   post-concussive syndrome – a severe functional impairment after a
   concussion. While we don’t wish to tell Dr. Kirkwood how to raise his
   own children, we think trivializing a 1 in 5 risk of persistent
   concussive symptoms is a disservice to the Denver community. Dr.
   Henderson and his colleagues have devoted years to developing reliable
   methods of identifying TBI, and now through specialized functional
   brain scans, with 94% accuracy we can distinguish TBI from
   post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This quantitative analysis is
   unlike anything available in Denver and this breakthrough was
   recognized by Discover magazine as one of the top 20 scientific
   findings of 2015. Dr. Henderson has looked at thousands of brain scans
   of patients with persistent symptoms after concussion. The effects of a
   concussion on the brain are hardly minimal and can have lasting impact.

   For example, one patient, who was a straight-A student in Advanced
   Placement courses had one concussion while playing high school
   football. Despite taking Advanced Placement Calculus, he suddenly could
   not do simple one-digit multiplication. His grades dropped
   precipitously. Upon going to college, he had D’s the first semester and
   failed the second semester. He became very depressed and anxious. Then,
   15 months after his one single concussion, he collapsed into a seizure
   while jogging. A SPECT brain scan (single-photon emission computed
   tomography) revealed a TBI involving his frontal lobes (studies show
   this location to have worse outcomes, e.g., Jacobs 1996).

   It bears remembering that 70% of all U.S. football players are under
   the age of 14 (Cobb et al, 2013). A helmet sensor study of 50 child
   football players, ages 9-12, revealed a total of 11,978 helmet impacts
   in one season (Cobb et al, 2013). Furthermore, the biggest risk of
   harmful impacts was during practices. Urban and colleagues (2013) found
   a group of 40 high school football players sustained over 16,500
   impacts in one season. Scientific studies have shown that repetitive
   small impacts can be just as dangerous as one large impact (Bigler and
   Maxwell, 2012; Peskind et al, 2013).

   Ex-NFL player Tyler Sash died at age 27 and donated his brain to study
   chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). His brain was loaded with
   abnormal tau protein involved in CTE. So Tyler, only nine years out of
   high school, already had the signs of CTE. His brain injuries likely
   began when he was a pee-wee football player, extended through high
   school, college and his very short professional career. A study
   published this week (Stamm, 2016) found football players who started
   tackle football before age 12 had greater cognitive impairment as they
   age.

   So, we cannot condone a laissez-faire attitude toward concussion as Dr.
   Kirkwood endorses. While we are working towards effective treatments
   for TBI, the science encourages caution and perhaps…something besides
   football as a sport. Track, tennis, and racquetball all train the
   reflexes and the body. One does not need to concuss the brain to get
   exercise or develop team spirit.

   * CONCUSSION FIGURE LEGEND: Tc-99m-HMPAO perfusion SPECT scan data at
   least 6 months after concussion from a patient with a single
   sports-related concussion (left) and another patient with multiple
   sports-related concussions (right).  Areas of persistent brain injury
   appear as areas of decreased function (local brain perfusion is a
   direct correlate of function) in the top-down view (top) and the left
   side view (bottom). Scan data is presented as a map of statistically
   significant differences from a normal database. The color scale
   indicates gray for areas that do not differ significantly from the
   normative database. In contrast, areas of green, light blue, and dark
   blue represent areas of more than 2, 3, and 4 SD below the mean
   perfusion of the normative database, respectively. (Oasis software by

   Are you experiencing behaviors, feelings, or other signs that have
   previously been undiagnosed or misdiagnosed? The answers may be related
   to a traumatic brain injury -- which we have treatment -- or a
   combination of other biological, psychological and circumstances that
   can lead to troubling conditions. Please contact our office to
   experience a full diagnostic review by Dr. Theodore Henderson, who
   specializes in diagnosing and treating conditions, previously thought
   to be untreatable or mysterious.

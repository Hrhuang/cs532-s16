   A commuter who was racially abused by Chelsea fans as they prevented
   him from getting on a Paris Metro train has accepted an invitation from
   Paris St Germain to watch the Champions League clash between the two
   teams next week.

   Souleymane Sylla, a French-Mauritian, was repeatedly pushed out of a
   carriage as supporters chanted "we're racist, we're racist, and that's
   the way we like it" as Blues fans travelled to their club's match with
   the French champions last February.

   Chelsea condemned the incident before the first leg of the last 16
   clash and five men were given football banning orders of up to five
   years in July.

   They all also received lifetime bans from the club.

   Mr Sylla had to take six months off work and he only used the Metro for
   the first time since the incident last Friday.

   He turned down an invitation from Chelsea to go to the return leg in
   London in March 2015 because the ordeal was too raw.

   The club made their offer as an open invitation, which remains in
   place.

   But Mr Sylla plans to go to this season's last-16 first leg on 16
   February, one day before the first anniversary of the incident.

   His lawyer Jim Michel-Gabriel told Press Association Sport: "Paris St
   Germain invited my client to be there and I think he will be there,
   with me.

   "He has decided to go to the match as life must carry on."

   Mr Michel-Gabriel added: "Maybe the supporters of Chelsea and Paris St
   Germain will think about what happened.

   "He feels okay. He goes to the doctor once a week because he thinks
   about what happened one year ago.

   "It was impossible for him to take the Metro. It was very hard for him.

   "He feels better and he started (using the Metro) last Friday."

   Legal proceedings in relation to the abuse are still ongoing in France,
   but Mr Michel-Gabriel said his client wants to return to normality.

   "The case is still in justice, we don't know yet when we will go to the
   courts," he said.

   "He thinks 'I have to take care of my family and I have to take care of
   myself'."

   Chelsea's ticket allocation for the fixture has been reduced by 700 to
   1,400 in response to last November's terror attacks in Paris.

   But the Metro incident, combined with violence in the city surrounding
   last season's game, was also a factor.

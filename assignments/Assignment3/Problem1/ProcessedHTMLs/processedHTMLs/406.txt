DeMar DeRozan's Toronto

   It’s about 2,200 miles from where DeMar DeRozan grew up, in Compton,
   California, to Toronto, Canada — although sometimes it must have seemed
   much farther. Like when he was drafted by Toronto in 2009, as a
   19-year-old college freshman. Now? Now he’s 26, a league fixture and a
   two-time All-Star who has made the city his home. And with the 2016
   game in Toronto, he gets to play host.
   [SP16_Nike_Air_DeMar_DeRozan_2_native_1600.jpg?1453944611]

   “It will mean a lot to be able to go out there and represent the home
   team,” DeRozan says. “That’s what it’s all about: Being on the highest
   level, being able to have people recognize Toronto for its sport—it’s
   something the city deserves.”

   It’s also about the homegrown talent that has been rising up in Toronto
   since Damon Stoudamire and Vince Carter began plying their trade in
   dinosaur jerseys. Now it’s DeRozan’s turn to be that role model, that
   player who the kids look up to. Somehow it has already been long enough
   since DeRozan joined the team that some of those kids have joined him
   in the league.

   “It is definitely growing,” DeRozan explains. “You can see the amount
   of Canadians that are in the league now and the young guys who are
   coming up who are going to be superstars. I remember seeing Anthony
   Bennett play in high school and now he is a teammate of mine. Seeing
   these guys, you can definitely see how basketball is growing here.”

   DeRozan had to do some learning of his own, especially in regard to
   winter, which he didn’t experience much back home in California.

   “Still to this day it’s an adjustment,” he admits. “My first year here,
   I was wearing Chucks in the snow. I didn’t know any different. I was
   wearing a regular hoodie instead of a down jacket. So I’ve had to
   evolve my wardrobe because of the winter.”

   He’s gotten a little help in that regard via the [148]Spring 2016 Nike
   Air collection: hoops-inspired, layer-ready gear that gets him to
   Toronto spots — or works equally as well when he’s just hanging at the
   crib on a day off.

   “During the season, I spend a lot of time at home,” he says of his
   off-days. “I just relax. But during the offseason, in the summer, I
   really got out and experienced Toronto. I went to the mall, went to
   Wonderland, went go kart racing. There are a lot of things to do in the
   city.”

   Over All-Star, he’ll get a chance to share them with, among others,
   Kobe Bryant, who will be playing in his final All-Star Game. DeRozan
   was just seven years old when Bryant made his league debut, and he
   intends to be a proper host to the player he calls “the greatest of my
   time.”

   “To celebrate him at the All-Star game, just like they celebrated
   Jordan, would be something you would never forget,” DeRozan declares.
   “As a kid growing up in Southern California, watching him play, it’d be
   extra special to be a part of something like that. It would definitely
   go down in history.”

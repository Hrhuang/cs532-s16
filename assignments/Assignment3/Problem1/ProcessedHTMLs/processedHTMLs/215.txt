   [39][bP5BcmSRID0.jpg]
   I manage the Tabletop Game Giveaways and Contests group on Facebook:
   [40]https://www.facebook.com/groups/TabletopGameGiveaways/  Nearly
   every day members of the group post new giveaways for tabletop games
   (and related items).  It's a thriving community of people sharing
   information about the games they are passionate about and ways to win
   those games from the incredibly generous publishers, bloggers, and
   other members of the tabletop games community.
   We just hit 1000 members in the group as a little celebration I am
   organizing a big giveaway of a bunch of items.  I've reached out to a
   number of sponsors and we have game prizes coming in!  This celebration
   giveaway will run for the month of February As more prizes are donated
   to the giveaway I'll list them below.  At the end of the month I'll
   draw names from all the entrants for all the prizes!
   Remember, sponsors are encouraged to enter too!  They just can't win
   their own prizes!  Thank you to everyone who is participating!

       game related items.

   The small print...
   Winners will be contacted via the email they supplied via the the
   contest widget.  Winners will have 48 hours to respond before a new
   winner will be selected.  Winning entries will be checked for validity,
   so any shares must be publicly visible.  Shipping locations will be
   determined by the prize sponsors.  Winners will be selected from all
   eligible entries.  Winners will be limited to winning two prizes from
   the pool.  I will do my best to match up non-US winners with prizes
   that can be shipped internationally.  Prize awards are the
   responsibility of the prize sponsor.  I will do my best to facilitate
   the awarding of prizes, but ultimately it is the responsibility of the
   prize sponsor to deliver the agreed upon award.  GJJ Games will only be
   responsible for providing prizes sponsored by GJJ Games.  Prize
   sponsors are welcome to enter, but cannot win their own prize.  GJJ
   Games and my immediate family are ineligible.

            Your odds of winning depend on the number of total entries and
            the number of entries you personally earn. Thanks for entering
            and liking the sponsor's sites!
            However in your case, I think your odds of being Odd are
            pretty good =)

       Your Twitter API rate limit was hit, so I couldn't follow all of
       the accounts.
       Also, I, too, love The Gaming Goat, but I live in Rockford, so it's
       rare that I ever make it out there.
       Recently, they were amazing, and did an even swap for a copy of
       Armada (I had two that I won from Boardgamegiveaway.com) for a copy
       of Imperial Assault, and I picked up Tash Kalar and Lords of Vegas!

       Bit of an glitch in the contest program. It gave me the +2 for
       visiting the "Tabletop Game Giveaways and Contests Facebook group
       page", which I wasn't able to. It just sent me to a facebook login
       page.

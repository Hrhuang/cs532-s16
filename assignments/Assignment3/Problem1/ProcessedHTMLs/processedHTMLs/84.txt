   What you’re looking at is an architectural rendering of TCF Bank
   Stadium for the upcoming outdoor game between the Minnesota Wild and
   Chicago Blackhawks on Sunday, Feb. 21.

   The current forecast for that day in Minneapolis is a high of 27° F and
   a low of 19° F, with only a 20 percent possibility of precipitation,
   i.e. snow.

   Which is to say, that guy in the Toews jersey is gonna be cold. At
   least roll up your sleeves, man. Don’t be a hero.

   The game, scheduled for 3:30 p.m. ET, will be broadcast live on NBC as
   part of Hockey Day in America, while Hockey Night In Canada and TVA
   Sports will have the action for the folks up north.

   NHL commissioner Gary Bettman has [102]upheld Dennis Wideman’s 20-game
   suspension for abuse of officials.

   Wideman had appealed [103]the suspension that was originally assessed
   by the NHL’s senior executive VP of hockey operations, Colin Campbell.

   [104]Click here to read Bettman’s decision. In it, the commissioner
   wrote that he was “left with the firm view that a significant
   suspension is appropriate” and that he was “troubled by Mr. Wideman’s
   total failure to accept any responsibility for his actions.”

   Wideman is expected to appeal further to an independent arbitrator.

   More to come on PHT.

In search of offense, Roy shakes up the lines

   Patrick Roy

   Patrick Roy has shaken up his lines ahead of tonight’s visit from the
   Montreal Canadiens.

   The hope is more goals. Roy’s Avalanche have scored just 14 times in
   their last seven games.

   From [116]NHL.com:

   … Roy is moving [117]Matt Duchene, who had been playing right wing,
   back to his natural center position to skate with [118]Mikhail
   Grigorenko and [119]Jarome Iginla. [120]Nathan MacKinnon will center
   [121]Alex Tanguay and [122]Jack Skille, and [123]John Mitchell will
   center [124]Cody McLeod and [125]Andreas Martinsen. The line of
   [126]Gabriel Landeskog, [127]Carl Soderberg and [128]Blake Comeau
   remains intact.

   Colorado’s coming off a 4-1 loss in Buffalo on Sunday — a game in which
   the Avs actually outshot the Sabres, 35-21, only to be thwarted 34
   times by goalie [129]Robin Lehner.

   “We felt like that was our best game of the road trip, and that just
   goes to show you where this game is sometimes. You have your best
   effort and you feel you’re dominating, but you still lose 4-1,”
   Landeskog [130]told the club’s website. “We got to make sure that we
   take that offensive game with us that we played in Buffalo, where we
   felt like we created a lot of scoring chances. It’s just a matter of
   putting the puck in the back of the net.”

   Of note, the Avs have some winnable games coming up. They get the
   Canadiens tonight, then travel to Edmonton to play the Oilers on
   Saturday. The day after that, they take on the Canucks in Vancouver.

   For now, they hold the second wild-card spot in the West. But Arizona
   and Minnesota are only four points back, and each have three games in
   hand.

The Flint Firebirds have fired their coaches….again (Updated with statement
from OHL)

   workout, Wednesday, Nov. 11, 2015, in Flint, Mich. The Firebirds were

   Hey, remember in November when the Flint Firebirds fired coaches John
   Gruden and Dave Karpa and then [155]hired them back the very next day
   after owner Rolf Nilsen — who was upset that his son, defenseman Hakon
   Nilsen, wasn’t getting enough playing time — admitted he made “an
   irresponsible mistake”?

   Well, today the Flint Firebirds fired coaches John Gruden and Dave
   Karpa.

   This time, they appear to mean it. According to [156]a press release,
   the OHL team’s director of hockey ops, Sergei Kharin, will take over
   head-coaching duties from Gruden.

   The Firebirds are last in the West Division with a 16-31-4-2 record,
   but [157]this is reportedly once again about Hakon Nilsen’s ice time:

     Lost in the news is the reasoning behind it, and that is once again
     that Hakon Nilsen was not getting enough playing time in daddy's
     eyes

     — OHLInsiders(.com) (@OHLinsiders) [158]February 17, 2016

   Supporting that theory, here’s what former Firebird Vincent
   Scognamiglio had to say about today’s firings:

     Really sad what kind of damage one guy with money can do to so many
     people [159]@FlintFirebirds

     — vince scognamiglio (@scogs15) [160]February 17, 2016

   The Firebirds did share some good news in the same press release that
   announced Gruden and Karpa had lost their jobs:

   Thursday is “College Night!” Featuring $2 beers and $2 hot dogs for all
   fans in attendance and all college students will receive $2 off tickets
   with valid ID.

   Tight ship.

   [161]Update:

   OHL commissioner David Branch has released the following statement:

   It has come to the league’s attention that the Flint Firebirds
   ownership has once again made significant changes to their coaching
   staff.  This change, the manner in which it occurred and the way it was
   communicated to the players and to the league is of great concern.

   We have been in contact with the team captain and it is our intention
   to meet and communicate with all players and families in short order.
   The players and their playing experience is of the utmost importance to
   the league and we will continue to work to ensure that they are treated
   with respect.

   It is the league’s intention to immediately review the actions of the
   Flint Firebirds before we determine the next steps we will take to
   address this situation.

   If Thatcher Demko doesn’t sign with the Vancouver Canucks by Aug. 15,
   2017, he can become an unrestricted free agent and join whichever NHL
   team he chooses.

   Canucks fans are naturally nervous about this, because the 20-year-old
   Boston College netminder has been outstanding this season. Demko, a
   junior, is 20-4-4 with a .935 save percentage for the [172]No. 2 team
   in the nation. Recently, the 36th overall pick in the 2014 draft earned
   his ninth shutout in [173]the Beanpot final, a 1-0 victory over Boston
   University.

   So, what’s his plan?

   “My plan right now is to win a championship here at Boston College,”
   Demko [174]told TSN 1040 today. “I’m not sure what this summer’s going
   to look like. I do have another year (of eligibility) here at Boston
   College, so I’m trying to stay in the present here, not look ahead,
   because it can be a distraction. We’ll see what this summer has in
   store for me.”

   Would he consider signing this summer and starting his pro career?

   “To be honest, I haven’t even talked to the Canucks about it,” he said.
   “Obviously, it’s a two-way street, so they’ve got to talk to me about
   it before it can even be an option. I think once the season ends, I’ll
   just touch base with them and see where they’re at and we’ll have a
   discussion about it.”

   The Canucks would surely love to get Demko under contract ASAP. He
   could play next season in the AHL, with an eye on joining the big club
   in 2017-18. ([175]Ryan Miller, remember, is only signed through
   2016-17.)

   Individually, Demko has little left to prove at the college level. So
   Canucks fans should probably be cheering for the Eagles when the Hockey
   East playoffs begin next month. For Demko, a national title would be a
   nice way to end his college career. Anything less and he might be
   tempted to stay.

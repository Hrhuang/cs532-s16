The year Carmel nearly lost in girls state swimming

   swim team.(Photo: Courtesy of Carmel High School)

   The Streak wasn’t that long then. Not even in double digits.

   Girls swimming was a fall sport in 1991, and Carmel High School had won
   five successive state championships. Six? That was not going to happen.

   New coach. New training. No superstars. And did we mention Elkhart
   Central was loaded, featuring future Olympic gold medalist Lindsay
   Benko?

   “On paper, we weren’t supposed to win the meet at all,” said Tiffany
   (Tryon) Becher, a swimmer on that Carmel team.

   Somehow, the Greyhounds did win. They beat Elkhart Central by six
   points, 190-184. They have been winning ever since.

   Last year, [55]Carmel had arguably the best high school team ever.
   Carmel broke national records in all three relays, featured four
   national champions and [56]won state by a record 266 points. On Friday
   and Saturday at the Natatorium at IUPUI, Carmel is poised to win a 30th
   straight state championship — which would be a record for all sports
   in all states.

   It wasn’t that way in 1991. The Greyhounds were vulnerable, and they
   knew it.

   “You didn’t see the state champions on this team. That was one of the
   teams that knew it had to overachieve in order to be able to win the
   state championship that year,” said Tony Young, then the Carmel coach.

   “They really put the team first, ahead of any self-interest. That was
   one of the things they learned from the previous teams that were ahead
   of them.”

   That was not the only thing they learned.

   Becher said Young contrasted to previous coach Ray Lawrence, who sent
   the girls through high-yardage workouts. Carmel’s swimmers were taught
   different stroke technique. Ultimately, that improved their
   performance, but Becher said the change made them nervous.

   Moreover, one of their top swimmers, Kim Trager, was sidelined by
   mononucleosis.

   “‘Oh my gosh, we’re going to lose this meet. Everything is stacked
   against us,’” Becher said of the swimmers’ state of mind.

   It was a season of anxiety for the coaches, too. Young said he had an
   all-star staff in assistants Jay Chambers, now girls swim coach at
   Fishers, and Tom Avischious, the field services director at USA
   Swimming. Young is now sport development director for Indiana Swimming,
   which oversees club swimming in the state.

   Trager (now Trager-Bohley) said in an email that the swimmers
   “respected and admired” Young and did not want to let the new coach
   down. Young said he had serious doubts until the two weeks leading up
   to state. That’s when Carmel brings in alumni, teachers, former
   coaches, pro athletes and other speakers to deliver inspirational talks
   to the team.

   “That made me believe,” Young said.

   It was not easy to believe, however, after sectional results were
   posted. Elkhart Central looked unbeatable.

   Although the state meet came down to the last event, the 400-yard
   freestyle relay, the turning point was the first event: the 200-yard
   medley relay, 50 yards by four swimmers in each stroke. The Greyhounds
   had won the medley en route to team titles in each of the previous five
   years.

   “In our minds, we thought we had to win the medley relay,” Becher said.

   Trager-Bohley was given a doctor’s approval to swim a couple of weeks
   before state, and she was a late addition to that medley foursome,
   which was seeded No. 4. Becher was swimming the backstroke leg against
   … Benko, the future Olympic champion. Young calculated Elkhart would be
   two seconds ahead after that leadoff.

   Becher was proficient at the underwater kick. Before rules required
   backstrokers to surface before 15 meters, she could go longer. When she
   touched the wall, she was only a couple of tenths of a second behind.
   Sara Thomas swam breaststroke and Stefanie Faust, a freshman, moved
   into the lead on butterfly. Trager-Bohley swam the freestyle anchor,
   and Carmel finished first — its only first place of that state meet.

   “It was just one of those things that created momentum for the meet
   itself,” Young said.

   What else is new? Carmel girls swimming dominates sectionals

   Carmel coaches kept a notepad, jotting down cumulative score after each
   event. Consolation finals became more important than ever.

   Thomas was unexpectedly second in the 100 breaststroke. Becher was
   fourth in the 200 freestyle. Trager-Bohley was sixth in the 100
   freestyle.

   The Greyhounds led by 18 points going into the closing 400 freestyle
   relay, but victory was not secured. Elkhart was favored, meaning Carmel
   would have to place higher than eighth to win the team championship.

   Coaches’ advice was simple: Do not leave too early on relay exchanges.

   “That last relay, I remember standing on the blocks, hoping I wouldn’t
   fall off because I was so nervous,” Becher said.

   Elkhart did win the relay. Carmel was fifth.

   For the sixth year in a row, the Greyhounds were state champions.

   Benko was a freshman then, so she would have other chances. But she
   said she knew from age-group swimming that Carmel would reload. This
   was their best shot, she said. Elkhart finished second in each of the
   next two years.

   “We came so close to being that one team that almost did it,” said
   Benko, whose married name is Lindsay Mintenko.

   She won three Olympic medals, including gold in the 800-meter freestyle
   relay in 2000. She has been national team managing director for USA
   Swimming since 2006 and is a mother of two.

   Becher and Trager-Bohley are educators and also have two children each.
   Becher teaches sixth grade at Fall Creek Elementary School, and
   Trager-Bohley is an adjunct professor of American Studies at Indiana
   University-Purdue University Indianapolis.

   Because of them and their teammates, The Streak is at 29 and counting.

   “For me, that was the sweetest win, because we had to dig deep to get
   it,” Trager-Bohley said.

   Co-main-event winner Roy Nelson ($125,000) and main-card victor Joseph
   Benavidez ($118,000) were the top earners at this past weekend’s UFC
   Fight Night 82 event.

   MMAjunkie today requested and obtained the list of official disclosed
   payouts from the Nevada State Athletic Commission.

   UFC Fight Night 82 took place Saturday at MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las
   Vegas. It aired on FOX Sports 1 following early prelims on UFC Fight
   Pass.

   In the headliner, welterweight contender Stephen Thompson (12-1 MMA,
   7-1 UFC) upset former champion Johny Hendricks (17-4 MMA, 12-4 UFC) via
   [64]dominant first-round knockout. Thompson earned $48,000 (half of
   which was a win bonus), and Hendricks pocketed $100,000.

   Nelson (21-12 MMA, 8-8 UFC), who [65]scored a unanimous-decision
   victory over fellow heavyweight Jared Rosholt (14-3 MMA, 6-2 UFC) in
   the co-headliner, earned $75,000 to show and $50,000 as a win bonus.
   Rosholt picked up $33,000.

   In addition to Benavidez, Mike Pyle ($106,000) and Ovince Saint Preux
   ($102,000) also pocketed six-figure disclosed paydays.

   The total disclosed payroll for the event was $1,054,000.

   The full list of UFC Fight Night 82 payouts included:

   Stephen Thompson: $48,000 (includes $24,000 win bonus)
   def. Johny Hendricks: $100,000

   Roy Nelson: $125,000 (includes $50,000 win bonus)
   def. Jared Rosholt: $33,000

   Ovince Saint Preux: $102,000 (includes $51,000 win bonus)
   def. Rafael Cavalcante: $42,000

   Joseph Benavidez: $118,000 (includes $59,000 win bonus)
   def. Zach Makovsky: $19,000

   Misha Cirkunov: $24,000 (includes $12,000 win bonus)
   def. Alex Nicholson: $10,000

   Mike Pyle: $106,000 (includes $53,000 win bonus)
   def. Sean Spencer: $17,000

   Josh Burkman: $90,000 (includes $45,000 win bonus)
   def. K.J. Noons : $34,000

   Derrick Lewis: $50,000 (includes $25,000 win bonus)
   def. Damian Grabowski: $17,000

   Justin Scoggins: $34,000 (includes $17,000 win bonus)
   def. Ray Borg: $18,000

   Diego Rivas: $20,000 (includes $10,000 win bonus)
   def. Noad Lahat: $17,000

   Mickey Gall: $20,000 (includes $10,000 win bonus)
   def. Mike Jackson: $10,000

   Alex White: $24,000 (includes $12,000 win bonus)
   def. Artem Lobov: $13,000

   Now, the usual disclaimer: The figures do not include deductions for
   items such as insurance, licenses and taxes. Additionally, the figures
   do not include money paid by sponsors, including the official [66]UFC
   Athlete Outfitting sponsorship program pay. They also do not include
   any other “locker room” or special discretionary bonuses the UFC
   oftentimes pays.

   For example, as previously reported, UFC officials handed out
   additional $50,000 [67]UFC Fight Night 82 fight-night bonuses to
   Thompson, Rivas, Pyle and Spencer. Thompson and Rivas earned
   “Performance of the Night” awards while Pyle and Spencer picked up
   “Fight of the Night” honors.

   In other words, the above figures are simply base salaries reported to
   the commission and do not reflect entire compensation packages for the
   event.

   Luke Barnatt’s UFC exit wasn’t glamorous, but it was essentially
   expected. But his upcoming matchup with Jason “Mayhem” Miller? He finds
   it downright bizarre.

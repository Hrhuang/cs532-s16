   [49]Call of Duty: Black Ops III / 9 Feb 2016

                      Black Ops 3 Gets Black Market Update

   Share.
   Available now on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC.
   By [50]Nicole Carpenter

   [51]Call of Duty: Black Ops III's next Black Market update is
   introducing three new guns, two new melee weapons, and 18 new
   specialist themes.

   The three new weapons are the MX Garand Assault Rifle, Marshal 18
   Shotgun-Pistol, and NX Shadow Claw Crossbow. The MX Garand "looks
   vintage," but has a few "modern upgrades." Perfect for getting
   up-close, the Marshal 18 Shotgun-Pistol is "like a warm hug," while the
   Shadow Claw Crossbow is silent and very deadly.

   Players can trade earned cryptokeys for supply drops, of which there
   are two options. Ten cryptokeys earns players a common supply drop, and
   30 opens a rare one. Each supply drop grants a player three items of
   one of four rarities—common, rare, legendary, or epic. Players can also
   get supply drops using [53]Call of Duty points, Black Ops' in-game
   currency that can be bought using real money.

   Players can access the Black Market from the Black Ops III loading
   screen, next, click on multiplayer, then select public match. The Black
   Market will be selectable from there, though it's suggested that
   players should be "ready to trade," given that the mysterious vendor
   doesn't like to waste time, and potential customers won't want to meet
   his newly introduced crowbar.

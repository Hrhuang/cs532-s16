   NBC Sports has released a promotional video to build up the momentum
   ahead of Sunday’s Premier League match between Arsenal and Leicester
   City.

   The Foxes take on the Gunners in a game that will be televised live
   across the United States on NBCSN beginning at 7am ET (pre-match
   coverage begins at 6am ET).

   NBC’s new promo video is entitled ‘Who’s Laughing Now?’

   After Sunday’s result, we’ll have a much clearer picture.

       It’s a shame for US fans that they moved the game to 7:00 AM Sunday
       from 10:00 AM Saturday. I would have much preferred the 10 AM time
       slot.

            Reminder:
            The TV rightsholders in Hong Kong (population less than 8
            million) and Singapore (population less than 5 million) both
            paid more money for EPL rights than the TV rightsholder in the
            U.S. (Comcast Corporation.)
            The BEST EPL matches on weekends prior Champions League
            matches will almost always be in an early time slot (Saturday
            1245 London Time, or Sunday either 1200, 1330, or 1405 London
            Time.) The EPL takes care of its Asian TV rightsholders and
            accomodate local police request to have “high risk” matches
            end before local sunset to aid crowd control.

   Emirates stadium went absolutely crazy following Danny Welbeck’s header
   deep into extra time against league-leading Leicester City on Sunday
   afternoon. Welbeck, who came on as a substitute in the 83rd minute, had

[226]Pochettino has Tottenham daring to dream of title glory

   [227]Leagues: EPL [228]Tottenham Hotspur
   AFP

   When Mauricio Pochettino first set foot in White Hart Lane, the future
   Tottenham manager was struck by the simple message emblazoned all
   around the middle tier of the stadium. ‘To Dare is to Do’, translated

   long before Pochettino arrived […]

[238]Leaked transfer agreement shows Real Madrid have limited buy-back clause
for Arsenal’s Mesut Ozil

   Richard Farley

   If Arsenal ever sell Mesut Ozil to a club in the Spanish league, Real
   Madrid have the right to match the transfer fee. And if they decline,
   Ozil’s former club would still be entitled to 33% of the playmaker’s
   final price. Those are some of the revelations from a leaked […]

   Fernando de Leon

   The divide between what constitutes a bad soccer owner and a good one
   is purely subjective; unless, of course, your team is flirting with
   relegation after years and years of steadily declining league finishes.
   It’s not fair to paint only Aston Villa’s Randy Lerner as bad at

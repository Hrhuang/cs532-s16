   Paris (AFP) - [95]Monaco's hopes of Champions League football next
   season got a boost with a 1-0 win over Nice on Saturday as Lyon
   rekindled their European challenge by beating [96]Angers 3-0.

   On a stormy, tense day in Ligue 1, seven players were red-carded in
   seven games.

   The Riveria derby clash between the second and third placed teams
   failed to ignite Monaco's Stade Louis II before midfielder Tiemoue
   Bakayoko struck after 81 minutes.

   A long free-kick off the boot of Portuguese midfielder Moutinho found
   Bakayoko who slotted in after the ball had bounced in front of Nice
   goalkeeper Yoan Cardinale.

   The win allows Monaco, second behind runaway leaders Paris
   Saint-Germain, to move six points clear of Nice, who remain third, two
   points ahead of Angers with Lyon moving up to fifth a further point
   back.

   Monaco's Moroccan midfielder [97]Nabil Dirar was sent off after he
   vigorously disputed a call by referee Tony Chapron, as Angers were also
   playing a man down following a 16th minute red card for [98]Thomas
   Mangani.

   "The players showed that apart from PSG, there is no team better than
   us. We know each other well, we know how to play at 10 and showed
   this," said Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim. "The players had a great
   match."

   "Paradoxically, the sending off seemed to do them good," said Nice
   coach Claude Puel.

   "If they continue to be successful like that they can even envisage
   catching Paris," added Puel of Monaco who trail Paris Saint-Germain by
   21 points.

   The reigning three-time champions will be looking to extend their Ligue
   1 unbeaten streak at bitter rivals Marseille on Sunday.

   Lyon secured back-to-back league wins for the first time since November
   and gave new coach Bruno Genesio a first league victory away from home.

   Last season's runners-up took an early lead through Christophe Jallet,
   and the hosts fell two behind when winger Rachid Ghezzal picked out the
   roof of the net just after half-time.

   [101]Corentin Tolisso wrapped up the scoring late on as Lyon moved to
   within three points of the Champions League places.

   "It is satisfying to have a second consecutive victory and what was
   important is the way we found confidence as a team," Genesio said.

   "I am not sure that it was a better performance than in the defeat at
   Saint Etienne or the draw with Marseille, but with our first real
   chance we got the opening goal and that is always so important now in
   Ligue 1."

   With eight of the bottom nine teams in action in the five late Saturday
   kick-offs it was unsurprisingly a tense evening of football.

   [104]Montpellier blew a great chance to haul themselves out of the
   bottom three as they were held to a 1-1 draw by ten-man [105]Lorient.

   Francois Bellugou was given a straight red card, and Kevin Berigaud
   took advantage to give Frederic Hantz's Montpellier a half-time lead.

   But [106]Jimmy Cabot scored his first goal for Lorient since joining
   from [107]Troyes last month to snatch a point.

   Reims made the most of Montpellier's slip-up as they saw off Caen 2-0.

   Goals from Thievy Bifouma and Prince Oniangue helped take Olivier
   Guegan's Reims three points clear of the relegation zone.

   [108]Bastia picked up a much-needed victory by easing past bottom club
   Troyes 2-0 despite having a man sent off for the fifth time in five
   league games.

   Goalkeeper [109]Jean Louis Leca's red card was sandwiched by a Floyd
   Ayite brace for the Corsicans, as visiting Troyes were reduced to nine
   men in a feisty encounter.

   Gazelec Ajaccio are now winless in six league games and just a point
   above the drop zone after playing out a goalless draw with fellow
   strugglers Guingamp, who had [110]Lionel Mathis kick off the pattern of
   the night with his 10th minute dismissal.

   Meanwhile, a 0-0 stalemate with [111]Nantes leaves [112]Toulouse
   second-from-bottom and six points from safety.

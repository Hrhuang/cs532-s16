   After a nice road sweep, the [78]Arizona Wildcats return home to try
   and avenge a winless road trip from earlier this year when the [79]UCLA
   Bruins and [80]USC Trojans come to Tucson.

   [81]Ryan Anderson had his worst game of the year against the Trojans,
   but is also coming off a Pac-12 Player of the Week performance in
   Washington. So something has to give.

   We talk about that, and one of the more confusing players on the team
   in this week's roundtable!

Jason Bartel: If you were explaining [82]Parker Jackson-Cartwright to someone
who had never seen him play before, how would you do that?

   David Potts: Imagine the best freshman basketball player possible.
   Imagine him playing games against other high school freshmen and
   destroying them. He's small - smaller even than the high school
   freshmen he's playing against - but the size difference is more than
   made up for by his skill and confidence.

   Now imagine that you dropped that high school freshman into a major
   conference college basketball game. The size difference is now
   tremendous and he can't guard anyone. He regularly gets his shot
   blocked when he drives to the hoop, he is hesitant to shoot against the
   much bigger players closing out on him, and his confidence is gone.
   Even the things he's good at - ball handling and distributing the ball,
   for example - he loses confidence in, causing him to defer to other
   people. And he eventually gets so discouraged that, in a crucial spot,
   he doesn't even try to run back on defense after a turnover. I think
   that's how I'd describe PJC right now.

   Brandon Hill: Your typical undersized point guard, nothing more and
   nothing less really. A player that can be effective at times and a
   liability at others, particularly on the defensive end. PJC was lauded
   as the best prep point guard prospect out of Southern California since
   Baron Davis by ESPN. He certainly hasn't lived up to that hype. I think
   Ulis is a great analogue because of their size and skills. And Ulis'
   freshman campaign and PJC's current sophomore campaign are very similar
   in terms of production (Ulis: 5.6 points per game, 3.6 assists per
   game, 44% shooting in 23.8 minutes per game; Jackson-Cartwright: 5.0
   ppg, 3.6 apg, 38% shooting, 21.5 mpg). Ulis has made an enormous jump
   this year. Time will tell if PJC can see similar improvement in his
   game. I don't think he'll ever be much of a shooter but he has shown he
   can be a good floor general... if he can be consistent.

   Ryan Kelapire: A fundamentally sound and smart point guard, but also
   incredibly undersized. Not only does that hinder him on the offensive
   end, making it tougher to finish through traffic or shoot over a
   defender, but it limits him significantly on the defensive end as well.
   "Normal-sized" guards have success creating their shot against him. But
   despite of his limitations, [83]Parker Jackson-Cartwright is still a
   useful player. Sure, he won't light it up on either end, but he
   (usually) won't kill you on either end either, and he's also been
   Arizona's best distributor in Pac-12 play.

   Ivan Leonard: Someone who can be tremendous in small stints like he
   showed last year, but can be a liability during long stretches. He can
   be highly effective in transition but somewhat meh in the halfcourt
   game. I agree with what Brandon said in that he is your typical
   undersized speedy guard for better or for worse.

JB: [84]Ryan Anderson's worst game this year came against USC. How do you
think he'll do this time around?

   DP: Much, much better. To harp on a point I make a lot: it's much
   easier to win games at home than it is to win on the road. Anderson has
   been on a tear lately, and I expect he'll put on a much stronger
   performance against the Trojans than he did the first go-round.

   BH: I agree, I expect a much better performance. Following the USC
   loss, which coincided with Allonzo Trier's injury, Anderson really
   stepped up and re-established himself as Arizona's alpha. The game
   immediately following that career-worst performance at USC (vs.
   Washington), Anderson went for 21 and 9 on 7-10 shooting and has been
   on a roll ever since. I expect a strong double-double almost certainly.

   RK: That game was just one of two games that Anderson failed to score
   in double-figures this season, so odds are he'll play much better this
   time. Not to mention that he's playing the best basketball of his
   season -- and probably of his career -- right now. Having a raucous
   McKale Center crowd behind him certainly won't hurt either.

   IL: The reigning Pac-12 Player of the Week should be able to keep the
   momentum going against one of the few teams he has struggled with this
   year. If Arizona wants to win, it starts with Anderson, and he puts up
   a lovely double-double on Valentine's Day to beat the Trojans.

JB: Will Arizona continue to gain momentum and sweep this weekend?

   DP: Probably. Arizona barely lost to these two teams on the road, so
   I'm confident that the Wildcats will be able to win both games down in
   Tucson and move a little closer to Oregon in the Pac-12 standings.

   BH: I will continue to approach each game with a level of caution and
   these games are no exception, especially with the home winning streak
   currently at one. But to David's point, both games in L.A. were toss
   ups and given how much better the Cats play at home I agree a sweep is
   probable (but far from a certainty). That said, it would be great to
   see Arizona play with a significant chip on its shoulder and avenge
   those losses. Cal is the only other team they've lost to that they will
   play again for sure. Perhaps most importantly, the USC game in
   particular presents Arizona's best opportunity to get a quality win on
   their [85]NCAA Tournament resume, albeit at home, depending on how the
   [86]Pac-12 tournament shakes out. The Cats' best win right now is
   Oregon State (RPI 33) or Gonzaga (BPI 31), respectively (USC is
   currently top 20 in both RPI and BPI).

   RK: Yes. I think the Wildcats will beat UCLA rather handily, but I
   expect the USC game to go down to the wire. The Trojans are
   particularly dangerous because they are a solid offensive team, and
   their style allows them to capitalize on turnovers, and we know taking
   care of the ball has been an issue for Arizona all season. That said, I
   realize the home-winning streak is over, but it's still incredibly
   difficult for opponents to go into McKale Center and come away with a
   victory. And I don't expect either of the L.A. schools to do so.

   IL: Yes they will because in order to lose both those games so many
   things had to go against them. [87]Bryce Alford is a career 39% shooter
   but he scored 25 on 50% shooting, while I still think Arizona beats USC
   if Trier does not get hurt. USC won fair and square but Trier likely
   hits both free-throws and more shots down the stretch if his hand was
   fine.

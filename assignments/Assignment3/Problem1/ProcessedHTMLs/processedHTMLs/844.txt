     __________________________________________________________________


   Gaming addiction has become a topic of increasing research interest.
   Over the last decade there has been a significant increase in the
   number of scientific studies examining various aspects of video game
   addiction. This has resulted in a wide-ranging selection of review
   papers focusing on different aspects of the topic. These include
   general literature reviews of video game addiction, reviews of online
   (as opposed to offline) gaming addiction, reviews of the main
   methodological issues in studying video game addiction, reviews of
   structural characteristics and their relationship with video game
   addiction, reviews of video game addiction treatment, reviews of video
   game addiction and co-morbidity/convergence with other addictions such
   as gambling addiction and Internet addiction, and miscellaneous review
   papers on very specific aspects of video game addictions such as social
   responsibility, screening instruments, or reviews refuting that video
   game addiction even exists.

   Furthermore, the amount and the quality of research in the gaming
   addiction field has progressed much over the last decade but is still
   in its infancy compared to other more established behavioural
   addictions, such as pathological gambling. Today’s blog briefly
   provides a considered (and somewhat speculative) examination of what
   might happen in the gaming addiction field from a number of different
   standpoints (e.g., methodological, conceptual, technological). These
   are taken from a paper I recently published in Current Psychiatry
   Reviews with Dr. Daniel King (University of Adelaide, Australia) and
   Daria Kuss (Birmingham City University, UK). These trends were loosely
   modeled on a 2011 paper I wrote on the technological trends in gambling
   and published in Casino and Gaming International.
     * There is likely to be an even bigger increase in empirical research
       into problematic video game playing and video game addiction. This
       will of course be dependent on both appropriate funding streams
       and/or whether gaming addiction ends up being included in future
       psychiatric disorder classifications (e.g., Diagnostic and
       Statistical Manual, International Classification of Diseases,
       etc.). Future research is likely to include more epidemiological
       and/or general population data on media use, leading to better
       insights into the onset and course of problematic video game play
       and addiction.
     * Given the many different screening instruments that have been
       developed over the last decade, there is likely to be a refinement
       of video game addiction measures and greater consensus on its
       conceptualization, either as a single disorder and/or incorporated
       into other known disorders (e.g., impulse control disorder). This
       is also likely to lead to improved assessment tools based on such
       conceptualization(s).
     * Measures of gaming use and subsequent behaviour are likely to
       diversify in terms of media use, including social networking sites
       (SNS) and associated Internet resources. Already, games such as
       Call of Duty and Battlefield 3 are being released with their own
       SNS (e.g., COD Elite) that track player behavior and provide
       feedback to players as to how to improve their game (thus
       functionally reinforcing video game play and thus have implications
       for excessive and/or potentially addictive play).
     * Given the pressure on media enterprises to ‘monetize’ their
       business and look for different revenue streams, there is likely to
       be even greater media convergence between gaming and other more
       profit-making activities such as gambling. Given the well
       established addictive potential of gambling, this may also have
       implications for the incidence of video game addiction.
     * Gaming on the move is likely to be a big growth area that may have
       implications for excessive gaming via ‘convenience’ hardware such
       as handheld gaming consoles, PDA devices, mobile phones, tablet
       computers, and MP3 players.
     * Given the fact that the Internet is gender-neutral, there is likely
       to be increasing feminization of gaming where increasing numbers of
       females not only engage in the playing of online games, but also
       develop problems as a result. Casual gaming online is already
       popular among females. However, the biggest difference between male
       and female gaming is likely to be content-based (e.g., males may
       prefer competitive type gaming experiences whereas females may
       prefer co-operative type gaming experiences).
     * Given the increasing number of research teams in the gambling field
       being given direct access to gambling companies behavioral tracking
       data, there is likely to be an increasing number of such
       collaborations in the gaming studies field.
     * Given the increased importance of additional research into the
       structural and situational characteristics of consumptive behaviors
       (e.g., smoking nicotine, drinking alcohol, gambling, etc.), it is
       likely that research on design features within games and their
       psychological impact (including potential addiction) will increase
       as well. Such research has already begun (including quite a few
       studies by our gaming research unit).
     * As the diagnosis of video game addiction becomes more legitimate in
       psychiatric and medical circles, it will lead to better randomized
       control trials on interventions for problematic video game play
       than the ones already carried out. There is also likely to be an
       increase in the online medium itself being used as a treatment
       channel. The reasons that people like to engage in some online
       leisure activities (i.e., the fact that the online environment is
       non-face-to-face, convenient, accessible, affordable, anonymous,
       non-threatening, non-alienating, non-stigmatizing, etc.) may also
       be the very same reasons why people would want to seek advice, help
       and treatment online rather than in face-to-face situations.

   Based on our review paper there are several noticeable trends that can
   be drawn from our recent reviews of problematic video game play and
   video game addiction.
     * There has been a significant increase in empirical research decade
       by decade since the early 1980s.
     * There has been a noticeable (and arguably strategic) shift in
       researching the mode of video game play. In the 1980s, research
       mainly concerned ‘pay-to-play’ arcade video games. In the 1990s,
       research mainly concerned stand alone (offline) video games played
       at home on consoles, PCs or handheld devices. In the 2000s,
       research mainly concerned online massively multiplayer video games.
     * There has been a noticeable shift in how data are collected. Up
       until the early 2000s, data about video game behavior was typically
       collected face-to-face, whereas contemporary studies collect data
       online, strategically targeting online forums where gamers are
       known to (virtually) congregate. These samples are typically
       self-selecting and (by default) unrepresentative of the general
       population. Therefore, generalization is almost always one of the
       methodological shortcomings of this data collection approach.
     * Survey study sample sizes have generally increased. In the 1980s
       and 1990s, sample sizes were typically in the low hundreds. In the
       2000s, sample sizes in their thousands – even if unrepresentative –
       are not uncommon.
     * There has been a diversification in the way data are collected
       including experiments, physiological investigations, secondary
       analysis of existing data (such as that collected from online
       forums), and behavioral tracking studies.
     * There has been increased research on adult (i.e., non-child and
       non-adolescent) samples reflecting the fact that the demographics
       of gaming have changed.
     * There has been increasing sophistication in relation to issues
       concerning assessment and measurement of problematic video game
       play and video game addiction. In the last few years, instruments
       have been developed that have more robust psychometric properties
       in terms of reliability and validity. However, there are still some
       concerns as many of the most widely used screening instruments were
       adapted from adult screens and much of the video game literature
       has examined children and adolescents. In other papers I have
       co-written with Dr. King, we have asserted that to enable future
       advances in the development and testing of interventions for video
       game-related problems, there must be some consensus among
       clinicians and researchers as to the precise classification of
       these problems. (In fact, we’ve just had a major review paper
       accepted on assessing video game addiction in Clinical Psychology
       Review which I will examine in a future blog).

   Clearly, there exist a number of gaps in current understanding of
   problematic video game play and video game addiction. There is a need
   for epidemiological research to determine the incidence and prevalence
   of clinically significant problems associated with video game play in
   the broader population. There are too few clinical studies that
   describe the unique features and symptoms of problematic video game
   play and/or video game addiction. While the current empirical base is
   relatively small, gaming addiction has become a more mainstream area
   for psychological and psychiatric research and is likely to become an
   area of significant importance given the widespread popularity of
   gaming.

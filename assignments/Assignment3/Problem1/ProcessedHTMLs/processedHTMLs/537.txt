   Jimmy Butler Injury Update: Bulls Star Ruled Out of 2016 NBA All-Star

   The [28]Chicago Bulls [29]announced Tuesday that [30]Jimmy Butler will
   be out three to four weeks while recovering from the [31]knee injury he
   suffered Feb. 5.

   As a result, Butler will miss Sunday's NBA All-Star Game. [32]Pau Gasol
   will replace Butler in the contest, per [33]Sean Highkin of Bleacher
   Report.

   Far more important than who replaces Butler is the fact that the Bulls
   now have a timetable for how long they could be without their leading
   scorer. Whereas this was once Derrick Rose's team, Butler is now the
   unquestioned leader.

   He's also one of the best 2-guards in the league, per ESPN Stats &
   Info:

     Jimmy Butler out 3-4 wks (incl. ASG), strained knee. Butler: second
     (+4.56) among SGs in Real Plus-Minus to James Harden (+4.74)
     — ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) [34]February 9, 2016

   Chicago is only a game-and-a-half ahead of the [35]Charlotte Hornets,
   who are ninth in the Eastern Conference, and only four games separate
   the Bulls from the [36]Orlando Magic and [37]Washington Wizards, the
   10th and 11th seeds.

   The Bulls could easily slip out of the top eight during Butler's
   absence. In their first two games since his injury, they lost to the
   [38]Hornets and [39]Minnesota Timberwolves.

   NBA Commissioner Adam Silver doesn't have an enviable task ahead as he
   fills out the East roster for the All-Star Game, but Bulls head coach
   Fred Hoiberg is in a much tougher position as he looks ahead to the
   next month with his best player out of action.

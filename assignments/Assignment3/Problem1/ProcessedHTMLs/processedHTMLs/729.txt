   Published on Feb 9, 2016

   This is a reupload of my Top 25 Sports Anime list that got uploaded on
   Feb. 6, 2016 and got claimed for:
   - Air Gear Opening 1: "Chain" by BACK-ON
   The changes include to this reupload:
   - Changed Air Gear clip to a custom-made one. ([16]1:55)
   I will also be reuploading my Top Anime of 2015 list, and it will be
   extended from 25 to 35 to give people a reason to rewatch it. :)
   Original Description:
   Last week was Top Mecha Openings, so this week it will be Top Sports
   Anime Openings!
   Since I forgot to tell you guys in the last description, I'll do it
   here instead. These lists are by no means Top ANIME lists, as in I do
   not rate the actual show. I figured this was obvious, but I got some
   messages from people that for some reason thought otherwise.
   Second, I know hardly any Sports Anime, let alone ones with good
   Openings. These were 25 of my favorite OPs of Sports Anime I know. If
   you think I missed something that absolutely had to be in here, tell me
   in the comments.
   I'll continue making these Top [genre] Openings lists as compensation
   for not working on Top Anime lists. I'm currently busy watching a lot
   of stuff since I want to improve the quality of my lists, but I'll be
   making some lists again really soon!

   ➣ Please do keep in mind...

   ● it as of yet.
   ○ Your taste is not the only one in the world. Do not attack other
   ○ people because they have a different opinion than you.
   ○ You might end up banned if you do.
   ● Please keep your comments constructive and informative.
   ● If you do this, other people will have an easier time understanding
   ● your points or your question.
   ○ Keep the upload date in mind. Some people are dumb enough
   ○ to ask me where a certain new anime is on my older videos,
   ○ when they weren't out yet. Please don't be "that" guy.

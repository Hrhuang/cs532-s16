Men's track & field to compete Saturday at Colgate

   Eli Saucier '18
   Feb 09, 2016

   Hamilton College travels to Hamilton, N.Y., on Saturday for Colgate
   University's Class of '32 Track & Field Invitational. The Hamilton men
   captured the Class of '32 Invitational team title in 2015.
   [202]Dylan Berardelli '16 and [203]Eli Saucier '18 have led the
   Continentals so far this indoor season. Berardelli set the school's
   35-pound weight throw record last year and has broken it this season
   several times. Saucier is starting to follow in the footsteps of
   All-American sprinter Joe Jensen '15, who graduated last spring.
   Berardelli's latest school-record performance came on Feb. 6 at Utica
   College's Doris and Walter Miga Invitational, where he took first place
   out of 23 athletes with a throw of 15.95 meters (52 feet, 4 inches).
   Last year he finished fifth in the event at the New York State
   Collegiate Track Conference Indoor Championships and qualified for the
   Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) Division III Indoor
   Championships.
   Saucier is off to a great start in 2016. He finished first out of 35
   athletes with a time of 22.48 seconds in the 200-meter dash and was
   second in the 60-meter dash in 7.12 seconds at Utica College on
   Saturday. Saucier's performance in the 200 is the 17th-fastest time in
   Division III as he chases a spot in the 2016 NCAA Division III Men's
   Indoor Track & Field Championship at Grinnell College in March.
   Jensen competed in two NCAA indoor championship meets and was a
   three-time All-American (twice for the 400-meter dash and once for the
   200 meters). He finished in fourth place in the 400 meters and fifth in
   the 200 at the 2015 championship and led Hamilton to a tie for 21st
   place in the team standings with nine points.
   Speaking of the national stage, all seven runners who led the
   Continentals to 21st place at the 2015 NCAA Men's Cross Country
   Championship are competing this winter. At Utica on Saturday, [204]Jack
   Moses '16 finished third in the 3,000-meter run. [205]Adam Pfander '16
   ended up fourth in the mile run and sixth in the 1,000-meter run,
   [206]Harry Sullivan '16 was fifth in the 1,000 meters and sixth in the
   mile, and [207]David Freeman '16 took third place in the 5,000-meter
   run. The remaining three athletes are [208]Jack Pierce '17, [209]Henry
   Whipple '18 and [210]Evan Abelson '16.
   Saucier was part of a 1,600-meter relay that set an indoor school
   record and finished 11th at the 2015 ECAC championships. [211]Nate
   Somes '16, [212]Leonard Kilekwang '16 and Jensen rounded out that
   foursome. Saucier, Somes, [213]Grant Whitney '17 and [214]Matthew
   McCarron '17 posted a victory in the 1,600-meter relay at Utica on
   Saturday. Whitney was also the runner-up in the 800-meter run.
   Somes and [215]Max Newman '16 are part of a school-record 800-meter
   relay. Whitney and [216]Peter DeWeirdt '18 ran on a 3,200-meter relay
   that finished eighth at last year's ECAC championships and earned
   all-conference team honors. DeWeirdt grabbed third place in the mile at
   Utica on Saturday.
   In the field events, Kilekwang is Hamilton's top athlete in the triple
   jump as he finished third in the event at Utica. [217]Rico Gonzalez '16
   competes in the pole vault and Berardelli ended up in second place in
   the shot put at Utica.
   [218]Ryan Sedwick '19 provides depth in the sprints as he finished in
   the top eight in the 60 and 200 meters at Utica. Some other top
   middle-distance runners include [219]Andrew Sinclair '18, [220]Colin
   Horgan '19 and [221]Reilly Shew '19.

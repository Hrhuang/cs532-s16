   [196]I need a few tips to tighten up my Bismarck game ([197]self.civ)

   submitted 8 days ago by [198]fletcher42

   So once discovered Bismarck and the barbarian thing, I just fell in
   love. I mean, what an imperialist ass. It's awesome. However, the first
   few plays turned into major late game wars that took ages (some I won)
   or very short games when I got the jump on some civs but ended up
   running my empire into the red. My approach with him so far has been
   very, uh, scorched earthy, and I know here's nuance I'm missing besides
   the Hanse Device...I mean, bank..whatever. Zo!

   How should I manage the influx of barbarians that join?

   What are some real strategies I can utilize against cities early game?

   How do I trade with civs if I'm planning on destroying them?

   I've done all of these things but with no real strategy. I turn to the
   great generals of [199]r/civ to school me in ways that I might make the
   Fatherland great once again. Much obliged!

    1. If you get too many, feel free to delete them for extra gold.
       Having a larger army early game is nice to ward off early AI
       attacks, but not necessary unless you are planning on early
       warmongering, which is usually a bit of a gamble.
    2. Get a bunch of Barbarian archers, save up some gold, research
       Construction for an easier Comp bow rush.
    3. Trade for gpt normally. There's no reason to not extract as much
       wealth as possible from them before annihilating them. MAke no
       promises and break them; that will massively damage your reputation
       permanently.

   On Hanses: Hanses can be amazing. They work quite simply:
     * Each city you have with a Hanse is improved as a Bank would
       normally.
     * Each trade route you have with a city-state (up to 8 normally, 10
       with wonders) gives +5% production in every city you have with a
       hanse, for up to +40% / +50% production.
     * That's it. It can be an absolutely crazy building because of this.

   And if you're at war with only civs, and play nice with the CSs, that's
   an easy, easy source of both cash and free production.

     How should I manage the influx of barbarians that join?

   I think at least opening Honor at some point is a decent idea. You can
   have roaming bands of barbarians you converted attacking more camps for
   gold and possibly additional converts. If your gpt is hurting
   prioritizing some markets could probably help. Delete units you don't
   strictly really need, warriors and stuff probably won't matter much
   once you are getting swordsmen and horsemen for example.

     What are some real strategies I can utilize against cities early
     game?

   You can zerg a civ with your barbarians, and if even if you lose them
   to attrition warfare it doesn't matter much since they were "free" in a
   sense. Units you directly produce (especially if they have xp building
   promotions) should be more carefully handled, but barbarians are highly
   expendable. Alternatively, even without war you can use those units to
   roam around and do some scouting. Getting a good sense of where your
   future enemies are (and what path you should take to them) ahead of
   time can be quite useful.

     How do I trade with civs if I'm planning on destroying them?

   So long as they are not Guarded you can trade fine until you take their
   goods forcibly for yourself. In terms of trade routes, with the Hanse
   obviously there is synergy to trade with city states instead of real
   civs anyways.

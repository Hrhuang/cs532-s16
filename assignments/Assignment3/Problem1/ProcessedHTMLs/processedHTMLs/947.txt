[138]Boston College Hockey Up To #2 In This Week's Poll

   [139]5
   posted by [140]bcinterruption on [141]Feb 15, 2016
   [142]uscho.com

   Boston College's ascent up the national rankings in 2016 continues,
   with this week's just-released USCHO poll pegging BC #2 in the nation.
   BC's Beanpot victory and 3 point weekend against Merrimack led to
   voters moving them up. North Dakota slid down from #2 to #4 after
   getting swept by Denver. Quinnipiac is still #1, though they've looked
   a little more vulnerable lately.
   5 Hockey East teams are ranked in the top 11 - BC at #2, PC at #5,
   Notre Dame at #7, BU at #9 and Lowell at #11. One other Hockey East
   team, Northeastern, slid in to the "also receiving votes" category.
   As a reminder, polls in college hockey are completely meaningless and
   have no bearing on anything, but it's another tool in looking at who
   the contenders are at this point in the season. In the all-important
   Pairwise rankings, which select and seed the NCAA field, [143]BC sits
   4th.

   In case you missed it yesterday, Conte Forum sprung a leak during the
   Syracuse-BC basketball game. Water cascaded down into Gate B of the
   arena, forcing fans to funnel away from the ticket office gate when
   exiting. This video [232]was taken by WCVB's Scott Isaacs.

[242]BC Women Win, Clinch Hockey East Regular Season Title

     Second trophy in 6 days! [246]https://t.co/IGksu5fEqP
     ‚Äî Joe Gravellese (@joegrav) [247]February 14, 2016

   With today's 3-0 win over the Vermont Catamounts in Burlington, the
   Boston College women's hockey team improved to 32-0-0 and clinched the
   Hockey East regular season title outright. They had clinched the #1
   seed on Friday due to holding the tiebreaker over 2nd place
   Northeastern, but now have assured themselves sole possession of first
   place.
   Katie Burt picked up her 12th shutout of the season, recording 16
   saves. BC outshot Vermont 42-16.
   The Eagles have two more regular season games left - a home-and-home
   next weekend against Providence. They will then face Maine, who is
   guaranteed to finish in 8th, in the best-of-3 Hockey East quarterfinals
   at home on the weekend of March 4-6.

   For the 5th straight Saturday game, BC ended up with a tie. A back and
   forth affair with Merrimack went down to the wire, with a Merrimack
   goal in the final minute sending it to OT. Neither team could score in
   the extra session and that was all she wrote.
   More to come.

   If there was one bet-the-farm lock on Super Bowl weekend — well,
   besides Denver’s defense — it was former Green Bay Packers quarterback
   Brett Favre would be a first-ballot selection to the Pro Football Hall
   of Fame.

   Favre was indeed one of the five modern-era players elected to the Hall
   on Saturday. He was such a prohibitive favorite that the 46 members of
   the selection committee never even discussed his credentials before
   voting. They didn’t need to. They knew Favre’s inclusion was a
   no-brainer.

   IFRAME: [68]inline-csprt-brett-favre-talks-hall-fame-honor

   But there was one aspect of the Hall selection process that I couldn’t
   understand, and it had to do with one of the 15 finalists who were
   discussed and voted on by the committee. No, I’m not talking about
   Terrell Owens. I’m talking about former Broncos safety Steve Atwater,
   who, like Owens, failed to make the cut from 15 to five.

   Simply put, if Atwater is a Hall of Fame finalist, why isn’t former
   Packers safety LeRoy Butler?

   In parallel careers spanning the 1990s, Butler was statistically
   superior and far more versatile at safety than Atwater. But what really
   set them apart was Butler was a pioneer, someone who changed the way
   his position was played in the NFL.

   Somehow, though, Butler has never received serious consideration in the
   selection process. He has been among the 100-plus nominees for years,
   but he’s never even been one of the 25 semifinalists, much less one of
   the 15 finalists for whom presentations are made to the committee.

   I don’t know if Butler has a chance at ever making the Hall because I
   don’t know enough about the secretive voting process. But I do know if
   Atwater deserves to have his case heard by the committee, then Butler
   does, too.

   Part of Butler’s problem is the safety position is the Hall’s
   red-headed stepchild. There have only been seven pure safeties elected
   to the Hall in 53 years. In the past 27, only one player who spent most
   of his career at safety, Minnesota’s Paul Krause, has been fitted for a
   yellow jacket. And even though Krause is the NFL’s all-time
   interceptions leader, it took him 14 election cycles to get in.

   Further complicating Butler’s candidacy is the competition at his
   position. Two more of his 1990s contemporaries at safety, Darren
   Woodson and John Lynch, have received Hall consideration and some
   well-known newer faces — Troy Polamalu, Ed Reed and Brian Dawkins —
   will become eligible in the next few years.

   Perhaps Butler’s candidacy has suffered because he was overshadowed on
   his team by Favre and defensive end Reggie White, both first-ballot
   Hall of Famers. Maybe if Green Bay had beaten Denver in Super Bowl
   XXXII, giving it two NFL titles in the 1990s instead of Denver, Butler
   would be viewed differently. Or maybe Butler’s career numbers would be
   harder to ignore if his career hadn’t been cut short by injury.

   Still, it is indisputable the Packers were among the NFL’s top teams in
   the 1990s and that Butler was its third-best player. Of the six teams
   that dominated the decade — Buffalo, Dallas, Denver, Green Bay,
   Pittsburgh and San Francisco — only the Packers have fewer than three
   players in the Hall.

   As for comparing Butler and Atwater, the advantage goes to Butler.

   He played 12 seasons and Atwater 11 at roughly the same time, so
   statistical comparisons are valid. In regular-season games, Butler had
   more interceptions (38-24), more sacks (20.5-5), more forced fumbles
   (13-6), more fumbles recovered (10-8) and more touchdowns (3-1). Each
   participated in 14 playoff games, with Butler getting three takeaways
   and three sacks and Atwater getting one of each.

   In terms of honors received, it was essentially a wash. Butler and
   Atwater were the safeties on the Hall-sponsored All-90s team and are
   the only first-teamers who haven’t been elected to the Hall. Atwater
   was in eight Pro Bowls compared to Butler’s four, but Butler was named
   first-team All-Pro (a much more prestigious honor) four times to
   Atwater’s two.

   Of course, Hall voting goes well beyond statistics and honors, but
   Butler fares well there, too. Atwater was one of the position’s most
   intimidating hitters and could control the middle of the field,
   especially early in his career when NFL teams still used power running
   attacks. Butler expanded the horizons of the safety position in an
   increasingly pass-dominated NFL, especially from 1994 to ’98 when the
   innovative Fritz Shurmur was his defensive coordinator.

   Shurmur lined up Butler all over and he was perfect for the role.
   Drafted as a cornerback, he was excellent in coverage yet he was
   physical enough to be a sure tackler and pesky blitzer. He was the
   first defensive back in NFL history to record 20 interceptions and 20
   sacks in a career. Showing the respect teams had for Butler’s
   playmaking ability, Denver built its entire game plan around
   neutralizing him in Super Bowl XXXII.

   Oh, and one more thing. Butler also invented the Lambeau Leap, one of
   the more enduring touchdown celebrations in NFL history.

   Somewhere in there is the makings of a pretty strong case for Butler to
   make the Hall of Fame. Too bad the committee hasn’t heard it.

   He is not, should not, and will not be in the Hall of Fame because of
   the disrespectful comments he has made of the late Reggie White, a true
   great and Hall of Fame'r.
   [87]csagrey
   [88]csagrey Feb 12, 2016 6:55am

   Reggie White was a great football player, but he was not the brightest
   bulb in the chandelier. His completely ignorant, dum bass speech to the
   Wisconsin legislature in 1998 was chock-full of racial stereotypes and
   intolerance for anybody who was not him. He should have been a
   poster-child for bigotry.

   So please spare us this nonsense about "disrespectful comments" by
   Butler regarding the great Reggie. Reggie was a moron, and showed
   himself as such. And to call himself a minister? What a joke!

   Toots, you might consider a new hobby. Revering and worshipping Reggie
   ain't so Fing wise. I suggest you read the following to fill in the
   blanks of your memory and reverance for the late, the great, the
   one-and-only, NFL hall-of-shamer, RREEGGGGIIEE WWHHIITTEE!!

   He was decent but there is local sentiment here, don't consider him HOF
   material from his era but I sure liked his play.

   Not all good/great players make it into the Hall of Fame! Plus, he was
   not a QB.

   [94]RichardSRussell Feb 9, 2016 9:22am

   As Vic Ketchman at Packers.com continues to remind us, it's the Hall of
   Fame, not the Hall of Pretty Good. And that may be the problem right
   there. Leroy was the quintessential Packer personality — good guy, got
   the job done, always approachable and congenial, never any
   controversies, 100% team guy, public-spirited, and modest to a fault;
   not one to toot his own horn. So, plenty of admiration but no outright
   fame, let alone notoriety.

   It would be nice if Favre would share some of the 90's glory and
   promote Butler.
   [97]RichardSRussell
   [98]RichardSRussell Feb 8, 2016 10:40pm

   A convincing case, but even if it somehow made its way to the proper
   ears, these are the same guys who STILL haven't recognized Jerry
   Kramer.

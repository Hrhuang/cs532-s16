Report: Browns lied when Johnny Manziel showed up to practice drunk

     * According to a report on the NFL Network, Johnny Manziel showed up
       to a practice inebriated and the Cleveland Browns tried to cover it
       up by saying he was in the concussion protocol. Photo: Scott

       the Cleveland Browns might be numbered after his latest off-field
       shenanigans and the hiring of a new coach.Click through the gallery

     * Dallas Cowboys Owner Jerry Jones reportedly coveted Manziel during
       the 2014 draft, and had to be persuaded from using the Cowboys'
       first-round pick on him. Adding Manziel to the Cowboys'
       dysfunctional family would add another ring to the Dallas circus,
       but since Jones craves attention and ways to make more money, it's
       within the realm of possibility. Plus, the Cowboys need a QB to
       succeed the aging Tony Romo at some point. Photo: Brandon Wade,
       Associated Press
     * Houston TexansBringing Manziel to the Texans might be the ultimate
       example of trying to wedge a square peg into a round hole. The
       Johnny Football experience is likely anathema to the bland
       organizational culture owner Bob McNair has built. Then again,
       Manziel would liven up a dull QB situation (does Brian Hoyer move
       the needle for anyone?) while dividing the fan base. And don't
       forget this team has brought in two Browns QB busts in the past
       year. Plus, we'd get to see Manziel and J.J. Watt trying to one-up
       each other for offseason headlines. Photo: Brett Coomer, Houston
       Chronicle / © 2015 Houston Chronicle
     * New England PatriotsWith the seemingly ageless Tom Brady, they have
       no need for Manziel. But coach Bill Belichick loves to thumb his
       nose at the NFL establishment (remember when he picked up Tim
       Tebow), so adding Manziel to tweak the rest of the league would be
       right up the Hoodie's alley. Photo: Bill Wippert, Associated Press
     * WashingtonOwner Daniel Snyder loves big names, so bringing the
       Manziel show to town would be par for the course for him. And since
       Robert Griffin III doesn't seem to be long for D.C., Snyder would
       just be trading one former Heisman winner for another. Photo: Nick
       Wass, Associated Press
     * Los Angeles RamsThis franchise has been a QB graveyard since Kurt
       Warner left town, so why not roll the dice with Manziel? The
       current Nick Foles/Case Keenum tandem doesn't really scare anyone.
       And, Johnny Manziel in Los Angeles? Sounds perfect. Photo: Dilip

     * New York Jets  The Jets crave back-page tabloid headlines like the
       rest of us crave oxygen. So bringing in Manziel (like they did with
       Tim Tebow) reeks of something ownership would do. Johnny Football
       in New York? Just imagine the possibilities. Photo: Jeff

       renting a room at the Kardashian abode? He certainly seems like
       he'd fit in seamlessly. Photo: Monty Brinton, ©2013 CBS

   make more money, it's within the realm of possibility. Plus, the
   Cowboys need a QB to succeed the aging Tony Romo at some point.

   Report: Browns lied when Johnny Manziel showed up to practice drunk
   1 / 11
   Back to Gallery

   Johnny Manziel reportedly showed up to a Cleveland Browns practice
   inebriated and the team covered it up by announcing that he was
   undergoing the concussion protocol, [226]according to the NFL Network's
   Michael Silver.

   "I was with a Browns player yesterday. Johnny Manziel, going in to what
   would have been a start late in the season, showed up drunk at practice
   on a Wednesday," Silver said on the NFL Network. "The Browns lied and
   said he was in the concussion protocol. Let me say that again: The
   Browns lied. To try to protect and, I would argue, enable this
   irresponsible and very troubled young man."

   The Cleveland Browns denied the report through a statement released
   Tuesday.

   "Johnny Manziel came to our facility on the morning of December 30th
   and complained of concussion symptoms," the report read. "He was tested
   by an independent neurologist and entered the league's concussion
   protocol. He remained in the protocol until January 12th after being
   cleared by the independent neurologist."

   According to Silver, Manziel showed up drunk to practice on Dec. 30.
   Manziel was ruled out for the game with a concussion and Austin Davis
   started in his place.

   An [228]NFL spokesperson talked with Mary Kay Cabot of the Cleveland
   Plain Dealer and said the league wouldn't have any comment on the
   report.

   "Mike Silver doesn't work for the league office. We don't have any
   comment on this report."

   Tuesday afternoon, Silver took to Twitter to defend his report. He
   tweeted that he regretted using the word "lied" when it came to the
   Browns, because he doesn't know what Manziel told the team when he
   showed up late for practice.

     I will address my [229]@nflnetwork report from Friday about Johnny
     Manziel showing up drunk for practice late last season in a series
     of Tweets.
     — Michael Silver (@MikeSilver) [230]February 9, 2016

     1) I've been told by multiple sources that Manziel showed up late to
     the tea facility for a meeting & noticeably drunk on Wednesday, Dec.
     30
     — Michael Silver (@MikeSilver) [231]February 9, 2016

     2) He was later placed in the concussion protocol & sent home.
     — Michael Silver (@MikeSilver) [232]February 9, 2016

     3) I am not a doctor & thus cannot presume to question the diagnosis
     of an independent neurologist or any medical professional...
     — Michael Silver (@MikeSilver) [233]February 9, 2016

     4) I do not have direct knowledge of what Manziel may have told the
     doctor or doctors who evaluated him, or what might have been
     suggested.
     — Michael Silver (@MikeSilver) [234]February 9, 2016

     5) If the Browns say they did not lie about Manziel's diagnosis, I
     will take them at their word, and I regret using that term ("lied").
     — Michael Silver (@MikeSilver) [235]February 9, 2016

     6) I stand by my original report that Manziel showed up drunk at
     practice & that witnesses believed this was the cause of his
     "behavior."
     — Michael Silver (@MikeSilver) [236]February 9, 2016

   In addition to missing the season finale with what was determined to be
   a concussion, he also didn't report to a scheduled medical checkup for
   his head injury on Jan. 3 amid a report he was spotted partying in Las
   Vegas. The team did not know his exact whereabouts that day.

   Following the loss to the Steelers, then-coach Mike Pettine, who was
   fired hours after the game, was asked if Manziel had been sent home
   earlier in the week because he was inebriated.

   "No. No. No, that is not the case," Pettine said.

   The Browns intend to release Manziel next month when the league begins
   its new calendar year. Cleveland selected him in the first round in
   2014, but the Heisman Trophy winner never lived up to expectations and
   now finds himself entwined in legal problems.

   Manziel currently is being investigated for an alleged assault of his
   ex-girlfriend. She claims [237]Manziel hit her so hard she lost hearing
   in her left ear.

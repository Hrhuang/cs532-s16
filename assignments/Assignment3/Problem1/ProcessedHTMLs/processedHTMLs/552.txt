   “This simple cart literally will change how we can shop.” — A very
   happy parent.<br>Everyone’s favorite
   I-ran-in-to-buy-two-things-but-I-bought-all-the-things (because I
   needed them, of course!!!) store inspires love in many of our hearts.
   Yesterday, Target inspired a little extra love by announcing a new
   shopping cart model. That’s right. A cart.This isn’t your average
   shopping cart, though. Nope. This is just a little bit extra
   thoughtful.It’s called Caroline’s Cart and it’s designed for children
   and adults with disabilities.Caroline’s Cart, coming soon to a Target
   near you. Photo provided by Target, used with permission.It gives
   parents and caregivers of individuals who are unable to walk on their
   own the ability to shop without having to push both a cart and a
   wheelchair simultaneously. The cart was designed by Drew Ann Long after
   she realized her daughter Caroline, who has special needs, would soon
   outgrow the kids’ section in a traditional shopping cart, at which
   point she’d be left to juggle a wheelchair and a cart. Long saw the
   need and knew that it was one shared by many families. She called the
   design Caroline’s Cart, named after her daughter, and embarked on the
   journey of patenting, manufacturing, and getting the carts into retail
   stores.The way Target became aware of Caroline’s Cart is pretty cool. A
   Target employee who is a parent of a child with special needs brought
   it to the attention of the store operations team. And so commenced a
   wonderful journey…Target began testing Caroline’s Cart in select
   locations a year ago. The response was delightful.It made many people
   happy, like mom Brianne Fuller and her son, who happened upon one in
   January.

   permission.
   Fuller wrote:
   “Shout out to the team at your Brighton, MI Target store for ordering a
   Caroline’s Cart. It made our evening shopping trip a breeze. . . and my
   son LOVES it! Please consider getting one for all of your stores, thank
   you!”
   Adam Standiford, the dad of a 6-year-old with special needs, felt
   equally thrilled when he discovered a Caroline’s Cart in November 2015.
   He posted a note to the company’s Facebook page that received over
   124,000 Likes and 13,000 shares: “Dear Target,
   I can’t express enough how happy my wife was to see this at our local
   Target today. We have a 6 year old handicap girl who either doesn’t fit
   in carts anymore or gets weird looks to as why she’s sitting in the
   basket and can’t walk like a normal child. This simple cart literally
   will change how we can shop, not having to worry as to how we are going
   to get her into a store. Every retailer in the country should follow
   suit! It is also quite ironic that my wife’s name is Carolyn and the
   cart is called Caroline’s cart. I will forever be Target loyal!
   Sincerely,
   Every parent of a special needs kid”Feedback like that surely gave the
   retailer the encouragement it needed to bring these carts to all of its
   customers. On March 15, 2016, Target will introduce Caroline’s Carts to
   almost all of its retail stores.”The vast majority of our stores (with
   the exception of a handful of our smallest stores where we don’t have
   full-size carts) will have at least one Caroline’s Cart, and many will
   have more, depending on their guests’ needs,” the company shared on it
   corporate website.
   I salute you, Target, because this is truly a case of listening to the
   needs of your customers (or guests, as you call them) and taking steps
   to make their shopping experiences easier and more enjoyable. It may
   look like a pretty ordinary cart…Photo provided by Target, used with
   permission. …but for the families who will use it, it’s extraordinary.
   <br>Target did not ask us or pay us to share their new awesome shopping
   carts with you. A friend shared the news, and I reached out to Target’s
   corporate communications department for more info and photos. I love it
   when retailers respond to the needs of their customers, particularly
   when it’s to make the experiences of parents and caregivers of children
   with disabilities better, and I want others to know it’s happening. And
   if customers realize that some retailers truly care, we’ll know that
   it’s worth it for us to ask! Plus, I like to believe it encourages
   other retailers to do the same. Consumers have powerful voices.

   Target’s newest shopping cart is a game-changer.

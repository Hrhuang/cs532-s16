   bowling, and information on various bowling products.
   Q: Why was BowlingAddicts.com created?
   A: BowlingAddicts.com started because 300 Games are rare moments in
   bowling and in a bowler’s life and with today’s technology (mobile
   devices), it’s much easier to capture these moments to watch and enjoy
   later on. We also thought it’d be fun and good for the bowling

   and website?

   Newsletter and you will get notified via email.

   channel and website?
   A: There is a backlog of videos due to the number of submissions that
   we receive. Please be patient.

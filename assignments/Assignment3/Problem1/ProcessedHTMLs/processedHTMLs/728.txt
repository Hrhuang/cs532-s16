            [138][DEL: @ :DEL] jjones9 when I looked at that replay he did
            try getting the football on the rebound. The perception is he
            just stood by and did nothing.

            [141][DEL: @ :DEL] j_ebs [142][DEL: @ :DEL] jjones9 sorry to
            disagree sir, but he made as much effort to recover that
            fumble as most people would to jump on top of a grenade

       [170][DEL: @ :DEL] jjones9 so Thomas Davis shows his commitment and
       Cam Newton shows his commitment. One is about the team and one is
       about Cam. No leader!

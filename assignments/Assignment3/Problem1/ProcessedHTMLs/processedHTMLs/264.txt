   Amazon.com Inc. [130]AMZN, +2.49% introduced a new service for game
   developers on Tuesday that will integrate with its cloud-based Amazon
   Web Services network and its video game streaming service Twitch. The
   3D gaming platform, called Amazon Lumberyard, is a free engine that
   lets game developers build high-quality games, and store them on the
   AWS cloud to be shared with fans on Twitch. The company also announced
   GameLift on Tuesday, which allows operators of session-based
   multiplayer games, such as esports, to scale capacity up or down in
   real-time based on demand. GameLift costs $1.50 per 1,000 daily active
   users, plus the standard fee for AWS. The move comes as Amazon
   continues to expand the uses cases for AWS and grow its client base.
   AWS revenue jumped more than 69% to $2.4 billion year-over-year in
   Amazon's most recent quarter, giving it a 7% share of total sales.
   Shares of Amazon fell 1.4% in premarket trade, putting them on track to
   open around $481.42. They've declined 25% over the last three months,
   underperforming a 10% decrease for the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

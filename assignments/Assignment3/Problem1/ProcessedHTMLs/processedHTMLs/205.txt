   Wayne Rooney has said Memphis Depay should not be blamed for Chelsea’s
   late equaliser against [53]Manchester United on Sunday despite the
   forward’s misplaced pass leading to Diego Costa’s goal.

   Louis van Gaal’s side [54]were leading 1-0 at Stamford Bridge after
   Jesse Lingard’s strike on 61 minutes as the game moved into added time.
   Depay, an 87th-minute substitute, tried to find Morgan Schneiderlin
   only to give the ball away, and after Chelsea attacked Costa finished
   beyond David de Gea.

   This caused United to drop two points, leaving them six behind
   fourth-placed Manchester City and 12 behind the leaders, Leicester
   City. But Rooney is not minded to make the Dutchman culpable for the
   result.

   “I think we’re all disappointed,” [56]Rooney told the Manchester
   Evening News. “Memphis is a fantastic player and that happens, we all
   give bad passes away. A lot of things happened from when you give the
   ball away to when they’ve scored the goal, so I don’t think we can
   stand here and blame Memphis. I think there were other things which
   happened and why they’ve scored.”

   United allowed Chelsea to take the initiative after Lingard’s superb
   turn and volley. “We did,” said Rooney. “The game was broken up a bit,
   we gave too many free-kicks away and then we couldn’t get up the pitch.

   “But with Chelsea, at times it’s difficult, because they pushed players
   up front and they didn’t really play with any system, so it’s difficult
   to work out how to defend against them. It’s a disappointing result in
   the end. I thought it was a good performance, I thought we played some
   nice stuff, but it feels like a defeat. We’ve performed well and played
   some good stuff again but, overall, it’s at this stage of the season
   that results matter and we’ve dropped two points.”

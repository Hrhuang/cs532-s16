Mobile Game Testing

   [16]09/02/201612/02/2016 ~ [17]matthiasduyck

   This is a series of posts on mobile game testing with Unity3D for my
   internship at La Mosca where I’ll be investigating how to limit battery
   usage.

   Today I started my internship at La Mosca in Ghent. La Mosca makes
   location based mobile applications for Android and iOS using the
   cross-platform game engine Unity. I have been tasked with optimising
   the battery performance of their games, specifically through creating a
   test application to simulate different scenarios.

   The games use various features of the mobile device such as the GPU,
   GPS and mobile data. Figuring out which of these features drains the
   battery most or can be cut back in some way will be the main goal of
   this project.

   It seems to be common knowledge that Unity3D drains the battery of
   mobile devices significantly and thus its use should be avoided if at
   all possible for things other than games, even though its
   cross-platformness makes it so great.

     Unity is a game engine meaning it will run as fast as possible
     instead of waiting for events. And because of that it will tax the
     battery a whole lot more than an event driven application.

     Also, if the most important thing is multiplatform, then look at
     other solutions that have that. e.g. phonegap or mosync.

   Prior public testing, specifically towards unity on mobile, seems to be
   very limited with the general assumption that lowering framerate or
   effects might be a good idea whenever possible, even down to 1fps.
   These are some of the sources on this topic I have found:

   I will be using this blog to report results and make notes of my
   thoughts and progress, finally found a good use for this dusty old
   thing! All posts related to this topic can be found [25]here, and

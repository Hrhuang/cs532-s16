Meet sports world's latest embarrassment, Cam Newton

   Tue, 02/09/2016 - 1:19pm
   [229]Tweet
   [230][mail.png]
   [231][print.png]

   Cam Newton continues to embarrass himself. (Mark Rebilas/USA Today) In
   whose world is this OK?

   And don't answer [232]Cam Newton, because he is clearly living on a
   different planet. And that's a place I have no desire to visit.

   This guy has boiled my blood in the last 40 hours more than any athlete
   I can remember.

   In full disclosure, I didn't like Newton even before Sunday. I didn't
   mind the touchdown celebrations, and I understand the need to
   self-promote (get your @bradfo T-shirts here!). But he always took the
   "Look at me" mentality to another level. It was like he believed a
   celebration didn't start until he showed up.

   I did always believe, however, that he offered a skill set that
   reminded me of [233]LeBron James -- where physical ability made it seem
   like he was the high school kid playing Nerf hoop against
   first-graders. So I enjoyed watching him play, but I didn't really care
   for the other stuff. Unfortunately, the other stuff was taken to a
   level that really extinguished any desire to soak in any part of the
   [234]Cam Newton experience from here on in.

   When Newton's [235]Super Bowl Sunday unfolded, some of the realities
   that come with Newton's current lot in life as an NFL quarterback were
   coming to light thanks to a historic Denver defense. As [236]Chris
   Harris Jr. pointed out with the QB sitting just a few feet away after
   the [237]Broncos' win, the game plan was to make the Carolina
   signal-caller beat Denver with his arm. Good move. Newton should have
   won MVP of the league for all that he did this season, but rather than
   gawk at Newton's new trophy, [238]Broncos defensive coordinator
   [239]Wade Phillips undoubtedly honed in on the quarterback ranking 28th
   in the NFL in completion percentage.

   This, however, isn't about Newton the player. This certainly isn't
   about the topic he felt obligated to bring up prior to the big game,
   race. And I'm not about to even suggest that he was one of top three
   reasons Denver is the champion.

   This is about [240]Cam Newton, a really, really, really misguided human
   being.

   It was idiotic that [241]Peyton Manning prioritized smooching Papa
   John. And publicizing his plan to guzzle Budweisers in each of his
   canned postgame media sessions wasn't too bright. Eli's reaction. Mike
   Carey getting another one wrong. Phil Simms and Jim Nantz offering
   another embarrassing broadcast. [242]Ron Rivera punting down two scores
   with just more than two minutes left. PuppyMonkeyBaby.

   For those whose job it is to bridge the gap between the end of football
   season and the NBA trade deadline, these all were welcome moments. But
   none of these should have the shelf life of what Newton did, and
   continues to do.

   The face of the NFL has appropriately punctuated a 2015 season at least
   partially defined by shame with a few of the most embarrassing images I
   can remember.

   Want my power rankings for Newton's transgressions? (Too bad, I'm going
   to give them to you anyway.) 1. His reaction Tuesday to not diving on
   his own fumble during his team's make-or-break moment; 2. His
   explanation for leaving his press conference early; 3. Not diving on
   the fumble; 4. Getting out of that aforementioned presser.

   Honestly, I never thought anything would be able to surpass my
   befuddlement when Newton backed away from that fumble. Was he just so
   beat up that he had enough? Was he, like his coach [243]Ron Rivera
   suggested, playing a potential rebound? On Tuesday some media members
   cornered Newton for an explanation. It was horrific. It was
   embarrassing. It was insulting.

   "I don’t dive on one fumble because the way my leg was -- it could have
   been [contorted] in a way," Newton said. “OK, you say my effort. I
   didn’t dive down. I fumbled. That’s fine. But we didn’t lose that game
   because of that fumble. I can tell you that."

   Actually, you might have.

   He had 1 1/2 days to come up with a reason, and that was it? How dare
   we question one of the signature moments in [244]Super Bowl history! If
   he dove head-first to try to recover that fumble and potentially save
   his team's season, his leg might have been somehow, some way been
   nicked up. And if that happens, he might not be able to get in that hot
   tub with Greg Olsen for another Gatorade commercial.

   And then there was this line when talking about why he couldn't bring
   himself to sit in a chair and talk about the biggest game of his career
   for a few minutes longer:

   "Show me a good loser and I’ll show you a loser,” Newton said. "If I
   offended anyone, that’s cool. ... I don’t have to conform to anybody’s
   wants for me. I’m not that guy. This is a great league with or without
   me. I am my own person."

   How about I just show you a loser. It will be in the next selfie you
   take somewhere in the midst of that next million dollar commercial.

   The guess here is that the reason Newton dug in on these nonsensical
   responses was because the people around him -- which include much of
   the media -- who have made him this way by bombarding him with this
   walk-on-water mentality, continued to cascade Newton with the kind of
   alternate reality they thought he has always wanted to hear. It
   happens, particularly with the kind of professional athletes who
   carries so many financial fortunes in his hands.

   Newton does a lot of good things for the community. I'm sure he can be
   a good teammate in some respects.

   Good for him.

   Right now, at this moment, NFL's Superman stands for everything that is
   wrong with this world of big-money sports we live in. And it turned
   out, the real world was Newton's kryptonite.

   We got a small taste of The Division in the recent closed beta, but the
   lore has still remained largely hidden. There’s much more to uncover,
   including the different enemy factions that stand in between you and
   rebuilding New York City.

   In addition to the Cleaners, which look like sanitation workers, we
   meet the Rioters, Rikers (prison escapees), and the Last Man Battalion.
   None of them are friendly to Division agents or each other.

   For those that didn’t get a chance to dive into The Division during the
   closed beta, circle February 19 on your calendar. If you happen to be
   playing on Xbox One, you’ll get in a day earlier.

   The open beta will feature an additional mission from the closed test.
   You’ll have until February 21 to play.

   The Division launches on March 8 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.
   For more, check out [74]our recent coverage.

       Looks awesome. Can't wait to try the open beta.

       Sweet, now I can finally see if this game will be crappy or a
       good'ol'time

       Even if I enjoy my time with this beta I'll still probably wait for
       reviews before I make my decision. Getting roasted by Destiny has
       kept me on edge about these games.
     * by [106]Tyadres Tuesday, February 09, 2016 at 12:08 PM
       WAIT?! You mean I get to play it again and more before it comes
       out?! If I could put in Po's reaction from Kung Fu Panda 3 here, I
       so would! I loved the beta and am extremely excited for the full
       game
     * by [107]StarscreamIsKing Tuesday, February 09, 2016 at 12:11 PM
       I hope this ends up being good, because I've been waiting for this
       game for years now.
     * by [108]SageXIII Tuesday, February 09, 2016 at 12:14 PM
       I didn't preorder it, so it's good to see there's an open beta.
       Time to see what all the hypes about.
     * by [109]Fernando Gutierrez Tuesday, February 09, 2016 at 12:24 PM
       Wouldn't it be more enticing as an RPG to have the choice to join
       any of those groups instead of being forced to play the good guys?
       I understand you can go rogue but that goes away once you're hunted
       down if I'm not mistaken.
     * by [110]zbad805 Tuesday, February 09, 2016 at 01:26 PM
       Oh good, I didn't get into the last one.
     * by [111]Arthur Edwards Tuesday, February 09, 2016 at 02:14 PM
       A logical question then arises: will there be situations where
       these factions' mutual dislike can be exploited by clever
       operators? A simple example would be luring a group of Rikers
       towards some Cleaners who happen to be 'working' in the vicinity.
       Might it also play into some of the missions as well?
     * by [112]Gdubbz Tuesday, February 09, 2016 at 03:28 PM
       Whats this "If you happen to be playing on Xbox One?" The game runs
       the same on either consoles so buying it on the console that will
       get all the exclusives first seems to me like the solid deal.

       Never go into the Dark Zone alone again. Join the SHD Field Agents.

       My dad worked out Rikers as a correction officer for 20 years, he
       told me a lot of nasty individuals are locked up there. I can
       imagine what'd happen if they escaped into Manhattan . . .
     * by [116]SGZone Wednesday, February 10, 2016 at 05:32 AM
       Looking forward to the open beta. I've been hearing nothing but
       awful things about this game so hopefully I can see how bad it is
       for myself.

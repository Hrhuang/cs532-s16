   choose to pay for the tickets through payroll deduction. Provided in

   Reserved gameday parking for Men's Basketball will be available in rank
   order. The ticket office will contact members in rank order that do not
   currently have basketball parking and offer them a parking pass based
   off of the lots availability. The ticket office is not going to be
   accepting new parking orders but will contact non parking pass ticket
   holders and give them the chance to purchase if spots are open. Parking
   passes will be $75 per pass. Ticket holders may purchase one parking
   pass for every 4 tickets, not to exceed 2 passes total. Parking passes
   are assigned in Bulldog Club rank order. There are 4 or 5 (depends on
   demand) lots reserved for basketball season, Lot A-which is the lot
   behind the hump and next to the Palmerio center, Lot B-which is the lot
   east of the hump, Lot C-which is the lot just south of the hump, Lot-D
   which is located near McArthur Hall. If demand increases for parking
   Lot E is the Soccer Field. Donors who have previously requested and
   paid for parking permits will receive their passes in the mail before
   the season. All other lots not used for Bulldog Club reserved parking
   are open to the public for parking.

   Improperly parked vehicles or those found in a restricted area will be
   towed (All cars parking on grass will be towed). Towed vehicles may be
   claimed by contacting the MSU Police at (662) 325-2121.

   The American Athletic Conference has released their schedules for the
   upcoming 2016 football season.

   For the Naval Academy's football team, their schedule will feature home
   games against four opponents who made bowl games in 2015 and an FCS
   opponent that beat Army. In total, the Mids will play seven teams that
   went to a bowl game in 2015.

   CBS Sports Network will televise all five games at Navy-Marine Corps
   Memorial Stadium, while the Mids' annual rivalry games vs. Notre Dame
   and Army will be televised by CBS. The Mids will have two prime time
   games on the ESPN Family of Networks, too.

   The 2016 edition of the Army-Navy game will be played on Dec. 10 in
   Baltimore at M&T Bank Stadium. The 117th playing of the Army-Navy game
   will kick off at 3 p.m. and will be televised by CBS.

   The Mids will be led in 2016 by head coach Ken Niumatalolo. This will
   be his 10th season as the Mids' head coach.

   Navy returns 43 letter-winners and 10 starters off last year’s historic
   team that finished 18th in the final polls. Navy defeated Pittsburgh in
   the Military Bowl to cap off the season.

   In 2015, the Mids finished 11-2 (7-1 AAC). Their only loses came to
   Houston and Notre Dame. The Mids topped Army for the 14th straight
   season and won the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy with an earlier season
   win over Air Force. The Mids were led by quarterback Keenan Reynolds,
   who finished fifth in Heisman Trophy voting. Reynolds broke the record
   for most career rushing touchdowns in NCAA Division I history last
   season.

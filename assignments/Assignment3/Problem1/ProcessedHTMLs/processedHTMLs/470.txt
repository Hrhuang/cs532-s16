Reports: ‘Strong belief’ Phil Jackson will leave Knicks, return to Lakers

   Report: 'Strong belief' Phil Jackson will leave Knicks, return to
   Lakers

   Knicks GM Phil Jackson may opt out of his deal and return to the Los
   Angeles Lakers, according to Adrian Wojnarowski of Yahoo Sports.
   by [239]SI Wire
   [240]Email
   Posted: Tue Feb. 9, 2016

   After the [241]firing of Knicks coach Derek Fisher, and an admission of
   failure on the part of team president Phil Jackson, there’s ‘strong
   belief’ that Jackson could eventually wind up in Los Angeles with
   fiancée Jeanie Buss and the Lakers, The Vertical’s Adrian Wojnarowski
   [242]reports. According to Wojnarowski, he could hire Warriors
   assistant Luke Walton or former Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau upon his
   arrival.

   This report comes on the heels of a note from the [243]New York Daily
   News’ Frank Isola that Jackson has an opt-out clause in his contract
   that he may exercise this summer.

   • [244]SHARP: How crazy are the Knicks?

   Amid much chatter regarding the decision to let Fisher go, Jackson
   typed out the following statement on Tuesday:

     I am sad about D-Fish. However, I'm not discouraged. Here is some
     things pundits should know before assuming 'next'.
     [245]pic.twitter.com/cFnA8TQAhx
     — Phil Jackson (@PhilJackson11) [246]February 9, 2016

   Jackson spent a total of 13 years with the Lakers, winning five
   championships as the team’s head coach.

   Kurt Rambis is currently serving as the Knicks’ interim coach. They are
   back in action on Tuesday night at 8 p.m. ET against the Wizards.

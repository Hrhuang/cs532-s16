   Montreal left tackle Josh Bourke is headed to the Toronto Argonauts.
   (lametropolesports.com.)

   This free agency period had less top Canadian offensive linemen
   available than usual, but it had one very good one in Montreal
   Alouettes' left tackle Josh Bourke, and he's now been snapped up. TSN's
   Dave Naylor [47]broke the news Tuesday that Bourke is headed to the
   Toronto Argonauts. As Herb Zurkowsky of The Montreal Gazette added,
   Bourke will get substantial money there, more than he was offered to
   remain with the Alouettes:

     Josh Bourke will be paid in the $230,000-$240,000 range by
     [48]@TorontoArgos. Received close to that from [49]#Als - but wanted
     him for less now.
     — Herb Zurkowsky (@HerbZurkowsky1) [50]February 9, 2016

   Bourke is a two-time league all-star, a seven-time divisional all-star,
   a two-time selection as the East's top offensive lineman and the 2011
   winner of the CFL's Most Outstanding Lineman award. He's a Canadian
   who's been able to consistently hold down the oft-American role of left
   tackle, and he's done very well at it. He's also from Windsor, Ontario,
   so this move gets him closer to home. Bourke is 33, so there are
   questions about how long he can continue to perform at an elite level,
   but some CFL offensive linemen have been able to do well into their
   late 30s. If Bourke can keep playing well, and if he can help keep
   veteran quarterback Ricky Ray upright and healthy, this may be money
   well spent for Toronto.

   It's notable that we're only a couple of hours into free agency, and
   the Argonauts have already been bigger players than they were in all of
   2015 free agency, [51]where they didn't sign a single player. They did
   lose quarterback Trevor Harris [52]to Ottawa, but if they were intent
   on going with Ray anyway, that may have been inevitable. Now they've
   landed Bourke, and they also made a key move ahead of free agency,
   signing Canadian middle linebacker Cory Greenwood[53] to a new deal
   Monday. It looks like the [54]new Argonauts' ownership group of Bell
   and Larry Tanenbaum is already investing in their player-acquisition
   budget [55]more than former owner David Braley did, and that's a good
   sign for this team's future.

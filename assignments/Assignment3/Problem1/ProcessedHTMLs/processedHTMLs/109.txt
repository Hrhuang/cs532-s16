Athlete of the Week - Fall 2015

     * [18]Emmaus swimmer Tom Schlechter is The Morning Call Athlete of
       the Week
       [19]Emmaus swimmer Tom Schlechter is The Morning Call Athlete of
       the Week
       Mike Blouse
       Emmaus senior Tom Schlechter has his sights set on Bucknell
       University as a future destination, Green Hornets swimming coach
       Tim OʼConnor said. No, not as a college choice. Schlechter is
       aiming to qualify for the PIAA Swimming Championships at Bucknellʼs
       Kinney Natatorium. The Emmaus standout seems...
     * [20]Salisbury Highʼs Lindsay Bauer is The Morning Call Athlete of
       the Week
       [21]Salisbury Highʼs Lindsay Bauer is The Morning Call Athlete of
       the Week
       Tom Mugavero
       Lindsay Bauer is making history for the Salisbury High School girls
       basketball team this winter. The senior guard, who entered last
       nightʼs game against Palisades nine points away from becoming the
       Falconsʼ ninth 1,000-point girls scorer, is the first Salisbury
       player since the modern era began...
     * [22]Week 15: John Jakobsen, Stroudsburg (wrestling)
       [23]Week 15: John Jakobsen, Stroudsburg (wrestling)
       Stroudsburgʼs John Jakobsen was so close last year to becoming
       Monroe Countyʼs first PIAA wrestling champion, finishing second at
       182 pounds. As a senior, Jakobsen is driving toward gold. Last
       week, Jakobsen continued his exceptional season, winning the
       195-pound weight class at the Escape the...
     * [24]Week 14: Dylan Belletiere, Salisbury (basketball)
       [25]Week 14: Dylan Belletiere, Salisbury (basketball)
       Salisbury is the last remaining undefeated team in area boys
       basketball and the Falcons have used teamwork to stay perfect
       through 13 games. No one epitomizes the team concept more than
       Falcons senior guard Dylan Belletiere. Belletiere scored 14 points
       in consecutive games as Salisbury knocked...
     * [26]Week 13: Evan Culver, Saucon Valley (football)
       [27]Week 13: Evan Culver, Saucon Valley (football)
       Tom Housenick
       Evan Culver continues to tell anyone who asks that his success as
       Saucon Valleyʼs running back is because of all those around him.
       The senior is going to have to accept some of the acknowledgment as
       to why the Panthers are on a record-setting run in the PIAA Class
       3A playoffs. Culver ran for 331...

     * [28]Week 12: Paige Garloff, Emmaus (field hockey)
       [29]Week 12: Paige Garloff, Emmaus (field hockey)
       Paige Garloff entered her senior season as a career backup waiting
       her chance, which finally came in her final year of high school. In
       the state playoffs, the Emmaus goalkeeper shut out Methacton,
       checked a Coughlin offense that had scored five goals in the prior
       round to one, limited a talented...
     * [30]Week 11: JD Haaf, Northwestern Lehigh (soccer)
       [31]Week 11: JD Haaf, Northwestern Lehigh (soccer)
       JD Haaf delivered early, he delivered often and he delivered in the
       postseason, too. A senior at Northwestern Lehigh, Haaf recorded a
       hat trick in each of the Tigersʼ first three games this season.
       Haaf continued to score at an amazing pace until he reached a
       District 11-best 108 points and his...
     * [32]Week 10: Devante Robinson, Dieruff (football)
       [33]Week 10: Devante Robinson, Dieruff (football)
       Dieruff Highʼs seniors played pivotal roles in restoring the
       football program to a respectable level. And perhaps no senior had
       more of an impact than Devante Robinson. The senior running
       back/free safety finished up his Husky career in style on Saturday
       when he was named the MVP of the Allen-Dieruff...
     * [34]Week 9: Zach Thatcher, Saucon Valley (football)
       [35]Week 9: Zach Thatcher, Saucon Valley (football)
       Tom Housenick
       Zach Thatcher had run for 163 yards and three touchdowns in the
       biggest football game of the Colonial League season. But the Saucon
       Valley senior quarterback made a brief plea with coaches to throw
       the ball on the final drive of last Fridayʼs showdown with fellow
       unbeaten Notre Dame-Green Pond....
     * [36]Week 8: Baleigh Bradley, Southern Lehigh (soccer)
       [37]Week 8: Baleigh Bradley, Southern Lehigh (soccer)
       Call staff reports
       Southern Lehigh girls soccer player Baleigh Bradley is making up
       for lost time. Bradley, a senior outside midfielder, missed most of
       her junior season because of injury. Heading into this week she had
       amassed 10 goals and eight assists. She delivered the game-winning
       goals for the Spartans in the...

     * [38]Week 7: Regan Allsop, Parkland (soccer)
       [39]Week 7: Regan Allsop, Parkland (soccer)
       Tim Shoemaker
       Regan Allsop was ready to be a varsity soccer starter at goalkeeper
       for Parkland as a sophomore, but the Trojans already had an
       all-conference keeper in Becky Webster. So Allsop worked,
       contributed and bided her time until Webster moved on to Penn
       State-Berks and she could have the job mostly to...
     * [40]Week 6: Caroline Ferrera, Freedom (volleyball)
       [41]Week 6: Caroline Ferrera, Freedom (volleyball)
       Caroline Ferrera and the Freedom girlʼs volleyball team have been
       busy. Coming into the Patriotsʼ four-match week, the senior setter
       had 953 assists in her career. Ferrera finished the week with 63
       assists including the 1,000th of her career on the Patriotsʼ senior
       night against Easton. Ferrera...

       Stephen Miller
       When the Freedom football team lost Roberto Diez to a lower-leg
       injury, Andres Santos became the focus of its rushing attack. The
       Patriots have continued to chug along with their new lead runner.
       Santos produced his best game of the season Friday, running 22
       times for 117 yards and two touchdowns...

     * [44]Week 4: Jake Stengel, Parkland (soccer)
       [45]Week 4: Jake Stengel, Parkland (soccer)
       Michael Blouse
       Parkland senior Jake Stengel hasnʼt been credited with a goal or an
       assist this season. Still, Stengel is very likely the Trojansʼ most
       impactful player. He is the teamʼs defensive stalwart and a
       captain. His play is a key reason why Parkland owns an 8-1-2 record
       this year and in prime position...
     * [46]Week 3: Paige Jones, Saucon Valley (soccer)
       [47]Week 3: Paige Jones, Saucon Valley (soccer)
       Call staff reports
       To say Paige Jones had a hand (or foot) in three Saucon Valley High
       School girls soccer victories last week would be an understatement.
       Jones, a senior, had five goals and four assists. That included the
       game-winning goals against Bangor and Northwestern and an assist on
       the game-winner against...
       Athlete of the Week - Spring 2015

     * [48]Week 2: Antwon Keenan, Bethlehem Catholic (football)
       [49]Week 2: Antwon Keenan, Bethlehem Catholic (football)
       Antwon Keenan said it was frustrating having to sit out most of the
       2014 Bethlehem Catholic football season with an acute ankle sprain.
       "It was hard, but I just had to stay positive," Keenan said. "I had
       a lot of support and it was good to have people around me to get me
       through it." The 5-foot-11,...
     * [50]Week 1: Blake Levengood, Southern Lehigh (football)
       [51]Week 1: Blake Levengood, Southern Lehigh (football)
       Blake Levengood waited his turn to become Southern Lehighʼs
       starting quarterback. He didnʼt wait very long to make his mark in
       the record books. The senior, who took over for three-year starter
       Travis Edmond this season, shattered the school mark for passing
       yards in a game and matched the second-most...

       [53]Northern Lehighʼs Amber Thomas is Coordinated Health Athlete of
       the Year
       Michael Blouse
       Amber Thomas was torn. She wanted to be at two places Wednesday
       night, but ultimately she picked attending the Coordinated Health
       Athlete of the Year banquet at SteelStacks in Bethlehem over
       playing in the Carole Weil all-star softball game at Patriots Park
       in Allentown. "I couldnʼt be at two places...

     * [56]Week 10: Jeff Strisovsky, Parkland (baseball)
       [57]Week 10: Jeff Strisovsky, Parkland (baseball)
       Jeff Strisovsky doesnʼt consider hitting breaking balls to be among
       his strengths. He put a good swing on one Tuesday night to give
       Parkland another championship. Strisovsky, a senior outfielder,
       cracked a one-out RBI single to center field to drive in the
       game-winning run in the bottom of the...

     * [58]Week 9: Austin Brauchle, Emmaus (volleyball)
       [59]Week 9: Austin Brauchle, Emmaus (volleyball)
       Austin Brauchle had to be talked into playing volleyball as a
       middle school student. Now, someone will have to talk him out of
       it. Brauchle, an Emmaus High School senior, is The Morning Callʼs
       athlete of the week. He had two kills Thursday in the Green
       Hornetsʼ loss to Parkland in the District...
     * [60]Week 8: Drew Hess, Wilson (track and field)
       [61]Week 8: Drew Hess, Wilson (track and field)
       Drew Hess figured his second javelin throw would be long. He didnʼt
       imagine it would go that far, however. The Wilson High senior won a
       District 11 title Wednesday with a personal-best throw of 206 feet,
       9 inches. The distance bettered his former personal (and school)
       record by 19 feet. It also...
     * [62]Week 7: Kaitlyn Toman, Salisbury (track and field)
       [63]Week 7: Kaitlyn Toman, Salisbury (track and field)
       Michael Blouse
       Kaitlyn Toman said she suffered momentary flashbacks to a season
       ago when, as the top seed, she no-heighted in the pole vault on a
       windy day at the Colonial League Track and Field Championships. "I
       looked over quick at my dad [on Tuesday]," the Salisbury High
       School senior said, "and I did have...
     * [64]Week 6: Noah Durnin, Northampton (baseball)
       [65]Week 6: Noah Durnin, Northampton (baseball)
       Noah Durnin struggled with his command against Nazareth a couple of
       weeks ago. He rebounded to lead Northamptonʼs baseball team to its
       biggest win of the season. Durnin fired a no-hitter against
       Parkland on April 23, walking three and striking out five in a 5-1
       win for the Konkrete Kids. Northampton...
     * [66]Week 5: Madi Marshall, Parkland (softball)
       [67]Week 5: Madi Marshall, Parkland (softball)
       Madi Marshall is in the cleanup spot of the batting order for the
       Parkland High softball team. Her bat is a big reason the Trojans
       entered play Thursday as the only remaining unbeaten team at 13-0.
       But Marshallʼs contributions to her teamʼs success go beyond her
       batting average and RBI total. The...

Athlete of the Week - Winter 2014/2015

     * [68]Week 4: Jeff Brown, Moravian Academy (lacrosse)
       [69]Week 4: Jeff Brown, Moravian Academy (lacrosse)
       Moravian Academy is one of the surprises in boys lacrosse this
       spring, and Jeff Brown is a big reason behind the Lionsʼ success.
       For the second straight year the senior midfielder is the teamʼs
       second leading scorer with 29 points and 14 assists. Brown had 13
       goals in four wins this past week for...

       [71]Week 3: Amber Thomas, Northern Lehigh (softball)
       After going 7-13, 8-12 and 7-13 over the past three seasons, the
       Northern Lehigh softball program is looking to make a comeback this
       spring. Bulldogs senior pitcher Amber Thomas knows all about
       comebacks. When she was 13, Thomas suffered a cerebral ischemic
       stroke. After a week at the Childrenʼs...
     * [72]Week 2: Brian Wildrick, Saucon Valley (baseball)
       [73]Week 2: Brian Wildrick, Saucon Valley (baseball)
       A cold, wet start to the spring has hindered high school baseball
       teams across the area. The weather hasnʼt stopped Saucon Valley
       junior left-hander Brian Wildrick from a hot opening stretch on the
       mound. Wildrick began the season by throwing a complete-game
       shutout Friday against defending Colonial...

       [75]Week 1: Andrew Sinai, Freedom (tennis)
       Thereʼs plenty of tennis to be played before the PIAA championships
       in May, but Andrew Sinai already has his sights set on the
       postseason. The Freedom High School senior is off to a fast start
       to the spring season with three straight wins in the opening week.
       Sinai has dropped just two games in...
     * [76]Week 14: Mike Comunale, Pius X (wrestling)
       [77]Week 14: Mike Comunale, Pius X (wrestling)
       Mike Comunale wrestled all season mindful of his schoolʼs history.
       Pius X, the Bangor school that opened in 1951, is scheduled to
       close this year. Comunale wanted to be its last wrestling state
       champion. Though he fell just short of that goal, Comunale still
       capped a proud season with a victory...

     * [78]Week 13: Jenna Forrester, Southern Lehigh (swimming)
       [79]Week 13: Jenna Forrester, Southern Lehigh (swimming)
       Jenna Forrester swims with special inspiration. Her father, Jeff,
       died in August of 2013 at the age of 52. "Sometimes I look up in
       the stands and I feel like heʼs definitely still here for me,"
       Forrester, a Southern Lehigh senior, said. "He always wanted me to
       do my best in everything in life,...
     * [80]Week 12: Kassie Behler, Nazareth (basketball)
       [81]Week 12: Kassie Behler, Nazareth (basketball)
       Kassie Behler said that the great thing about the Nazareth girls
       basketball team is that "everyone contributes in a different way."
       Behlerʼs contributions usually have more to do with passing than
       scoring, but in last weekʼs District 11 4A title game against
       Easton, things changed. The senior guard...
     * [82]Week 11: Phil Pierfy, Wilson (basketball)
       [83]Week 11: Phil Pierfy, Wilson (basketball)
       His basketball career didnʼt end the way Phil Pierfy wanted it to.
       Pierfyʼs Wilson Warriors were routed 61-31 by Salisbury in the
       District 11 3A quarterfinals, but the season, as a whole, was still
       a success. "Once a couple of days go by and you step away from the
       bitter taste of how it ended,...

       [85]Week 10: Carter Paules, Emmaus (swimming)
       Before Carter Paules joins his brother, Evan, at Rider University,
       he has several goals he hopes to attain as a senior at Emmaus High
       School. Paules started off what he expects to be a fulfilling final
       month on the Green Hornetsʼ swim team in last Thursdayʼs Eastern
       Pennsylvania Conference meet...

       [87]Week 9: Nicole Sagl, Central Catholic (diving)
       Nicole Sagl is determined to make the final few weeks of her
       scholastic diving career memorable ones. The Central Catholic
       senior captured the Eastern Pennsylvania Conference diving
       championship on Saturday at Parkland High School. Her 11-dive score

       [89]Week 8: Hassan Greenfield, Easton (basketball)
       The Easton boys basketball team began the season with three losses
       and was 4-8 in mid-January. However, the Red Rovers regrouped to
       win six in a row and Tuesday night they clinched a District 11
       berth with a 77-52 win over Dieruff. Senior Hassan Greenfield has
       been at the forefront of the Roversʼ...

       Saucon Valleyʼs Jason Lynch hasnʼt lost since finishing fifth at
       170 pounds at the prestigious Beast of the East Classic in
       December, although he did not wrestle in the Bethlehem Holiday
       Classic the following week. Last year he won 41 matches on his way
       to a third-place finish at the PIAA 2A District...

       [93]Week 6: Sam Magnan, Freedom (swimming)
       Sam Magnanʼs long-term goals are focused on the 2016 U.S. Olympic
       Swimming Trials. His short-term goal is to win a state swimming
       championship in the 500-yard freestyle. The Freedom High School
       senior remained undefeated this scholastic swim season with wins
       Thursday in the 100 and 200 freestyle...

       [95]Week 5: Brett Kline, Nazareth (basketball)
       Like other seniors on the Nazareth basketball team, Brett Kline has
       been through some lean times. The Blue Eagles were 9-13 last year,
       7-15 two seasons ago. But Nazareth is on the rise and Kline has
       been at the forefront of the resurgence. He scored 21 points in an
       80-63 come-from-behind win over...

       There have been a number of very talented girls basketball players
       to come through the Central Catholic program over the years and
       Alyssa Mack added her name to the list with her performance this
       past weekend — if it wasn’t already there. Not only did Mack reach

       Andrew Dunn has come a long way in his four seasons as a wrestler
       at Bethlehem Catholic. As a freshman, he finished 21-14 and did not
       place at the District 11 Class 2A tournament. As a senior so far,
       heʼs 15-0 with a national ranking and a scholarship to Virginia
       Tech. Dunn won the 220-pound title...

       Keith Groller
       Liberty High boys basketball coach Chad Landis has said this yearʼs
       Hurricanes donʼt possess a marquee player of the magnitude of past
       stars such as current Villanova senior Darrun Hilliard. Instead,
       Liberty relies on a team-oriented concept. No one shines with that
       concept better than Ludwin Gonzalez....

       After being named The Morning Callʼs player of the year for the
       second time last year, Bethlehem Catholic senior Kalista Walters
       has continued her success as she begins this season, once again, as
       one of the areaʼs best. The two-time Lehigh Valley Conference MVP

       Parklandʼs Brooke Robertson could not have asked for a better

       hitter helped the Trojans complete their perfect season (25-0) with
       a win in the PIAA Class 3A championship match over two-time
       defending champion Hempfield on Saturday...

       [107]Week 11: Cam Richardson, Northwestern (football)
       Northwesternʼs Cam Richardson is one of the most dangerous
       receivers in the Colonial League. Heʼs one of the most dangerous
       runners in the league as well. Last week the 5-foot-7, 160-pounder
       reached a milestone few high school players have in the area,
       becoming the first Tiger in the programʼs...

       [109]Week 10: Jake Young, Freedom (football)
       Healthy from the start this season, Freedom senior Jake Young has
       flourished as a full-time wide receiver. He had his best game yet
       against the Patriotsʼ chief rival. Young caught nine passes for 196
       yards, both season-highs, and two touchdowns in a 29-0 win against
       Liberty last week. He also had...

       Itʼs been the same story this season for Eastonʼs Colin Abert.
       Another race, another victory. His latest came last Thursday at the
       District 11 Cross Country Championships. Abert, a senior, won the
       Class 3A boys race in a time of 15 minutes, 43 seconds — tying the

       Kara Chyung is putting the finishing touches on a fantastic
       four-year career as a tennis player at Moravian Academy. The senior
       captured her second District 11 Class 2A doubles crown last week.

       [119]Week 5: Michael McDaniel, Bethlehem Catholic (football)
       Keith Groller
       The Bethlehem Catholic football team possesses so many offensive
       weapons that itʼs hard to rack up impressive numbers. Senior
       running back Michael McDaniel has been able to compile snazzy stats
       even with the Golden Hawks spreading the ball around. McDaniel has
       helped Becahi get off to a 5-0 start...

       last several seasons, and still is — the Zephyrs have scored 39

       the Zephyrs have some talent on the other side of the field, too.

     * [124]Week 2: Travis Edmond, Southern Lehigh (football)
       [125]Week 2: Travis Edmond, Southern Lehigh (football)
       Palisades geared up to stop Travis Edmondʼs passing in Southern
       Lehighʼs opening game, so Spartans coach John Toman had his senior
       quarterback hand off more than show off his passing arm, a big
       reason why Edmond threw for only 75 yards. Last week, when Wilson
       focused on stopping the Spartans on...
     * [126]Week 1: Wyl Miller, Emmaus (football)
       [127]Week 1: Wyl Miller, Emmaus (football)

       scholarship offers to match some of his fellow Eastern Pennsylvania
       Conference running backs. No South Division back chewed up more

       the 100- and 200-meter races but did not medal in either event at

       Palisades High softball coach Michelle Borzok calls senior catcher
       Melissa Albe "the complete package." "Sheʼs a catcher, but sheʼs

       the best batting average on the team," Borzok said.Albe is hitting

       Warriors are off to a 3-0 start and senior pitcher Madison Oren is
       a big reason why.She has allowed...

       Dame-Green Pond last season. This season the Crusaders are counting

       If the value of senior Nick Rindock to this yearʼs Parkland boys
       basketball team wasnʼt apparent before he suffered a sprained
       ankle, it was definitely clear after he went down in a Jan. 26 game
       against Gill St. Bernardʼs. While healing, Rindock missed
       regular-season games against Central Catholic...

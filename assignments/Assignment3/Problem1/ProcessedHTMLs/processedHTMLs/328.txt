   This is the 19th in a series of stories on[55] top all-time teams in
   Indiana high school history.

   Warren Central's 2006 football season could have gone awry.

   For one thing, the Warriors were coming off a third successive Class 5A
   state championship, and complacency is an enemy. For another, they were
   losing their coach, Kevin Wright, who accepted a job at a high school
   in Tulsa, Okla.

   "That's just a tough thing when you're a kid," former Warren Central
   principal Tony Burchett recalled.

   Finally, the Warriors knew they were going to rely on a new
   quarterback. The coaches didn't have anxiety long. Upon resumption of
   school Monday after the 2005 title game, there was one player working
   out in the weight room: Matt Upshaw, who knew he would be the 2006
   quarterback.

   Warren Central had the leadership. It had the motivation. It had the
   talent.

   Oh boy, that talent.

   The Warriors featured two Parade All-Americans, defensive back Jerimy
   Finch and running back Darren Evans, the IndyStar Mr. Football. Five
   players went on to sign NFL contracts. Ten played Division I college
   football.

   In an early-season showdown between No. 1 Warren Central and No. 2 Ben
   Davis, the Warriors won 76-7. Heading into the 5A championship, they
   outscored five postseason opponents 236-13.

   "Coaching's sometimes overrated," said Steve Tutsie, who in his first
   year as head coach oversaw the greatest team in Indiana high school
   football history.

   There are others that could make a claim to all-time No. 1 status:

   • Manual outscored opponents 442-38 in 1958.

   • Evansville Reitz, led by future Illinois and Atlanta Falcons
   linebacker Don Hansen, was unscored upon in 1961.

   • Warren Central was a juggernaut in 1985 under quarterback Jeff
   George, a No. 1 NFL draft pick by the Indianapolis Colts.

   • Ben Davis was named national champion in 1991.

   High school football has progressed in Indiana over the subsequent
   years, largely influenced by two people: Dick Dullaghan and Peyton
   Manning. Dullaghan, the former Ben Davis coach, told Tutsie the '06
   Warren Central was the best team he had ever seen.

   "That says a lot," Tutsie said.

   It said a lot that even after three successive state championships,
   Warren Central aimed higher. At the end of the season, the Warriors
   were ranked fourth nationally by ESPN and USA Today, and a case could
   be made that they were underrated.

   Their Game 2 victory was by 61-12 over Maine South, a suburban Chicago
   school coming off a runner-up finish in Illinois' largest class (8A).

   Among Tutsie's ploys was to make "212 degrees" a team motto. Water is
   hot at 211. It boils at 212.

   Warren Central boiled over against Ben Davis, underscoring the fact
   that this was a force unlike anything seen before in this state. Evans
   scored six touchdowns against the Giants — half the times he touched
   the ball — and rushed for 243 yards. His TDs included runs of 65, 55
   and 51 yards.

   "We (have) seen how good we could be," Evans said. "I think we wanted
   to match that every week."

   Evans rushed for 201 yards and three touchdowns in the climactic 35-14
   victory over Carmel in the championship game at the RCA Dome.

   He rushed for 61 touchdowns that season — then No. 4 in U.S. history
   and still No. 6 — and 2,806 yards. And that was against opponents in
   the Metropolitan Interscholastic Conference, one of the nation's
   strongest leagues and featuring schools with the largest enrollments.
   Contemporaries included future NFL players such as MarQueis Gray and
   Tandon Doss, both of Ben Davis, and North Central running back Chad
   Spann.

   The Warriors recorded five shutouts in an era when scoring was much
   higher than a half-century ago. As spectacular as Warren Central's
   offense was, Tutsie said, the defense might have been as good. Carmel
   quarterback Andrew Durbin could attest to that.

   "They just keep coming at you, and there's nothing you can do about
   it," Durbin said after the championship game.

   Warren Central passed infrequently, so wide receiver Adrien Robinson
   had modest statistics that year: 28 catches. But he averaged 31 yards
   on those receptions.

   Robinson scored his first NFL touchdown on a 1-yard pass from New York
   Giants quarterback Eli Manning against the Dallas Cowboys last Nov. 23.
   Other alumni in the NFL were Evans (Virginia Tech), an Orange Bowl MVP
   who was briefly with the Colts and Tennessee Titans; running back
   Jewell Hampton (Iowa/Southern Illinois), San Francisco 49ers; offensive
   lineman Andrew McDonald (Indiana), whose five teams included the Colts,
   and tight end Ed Hazelett (Western Kentucky), an undrafted free agent
   signed by the Oakland Raiders.

   Life after Warren Central has been bumpy for some.

   Evans, 26, is a customer service associate for Essco Indy, a supplier
   of equipment for those handling hazardous waste. Injuries contributed
   to an early end to his football career, and he speculated that
   concussions have affected him. He said he would play with headaches and
   take Tylenol later.

   "It hasn't played a big part in my life," Evans said. "But I can tell a
   difference."

   McDonald has undergone surgery for testicular cancer. He was identified
   as one of those harassed in the Miami Dolphins' bullying scandal,
   although his agent later refuted the report.

   Finch was never the same player after he broke his leg early in his
   career at Florida. He transferred to Indiana and then to Marian
   University. In December, he was sentenced to a year of probation in a
   plea agreement after being arrested by Beech Grove police offers in
   connection with a liquor store burglary. The burglary charge was
   dismissed.

   Back in that magical fall, the Warriors could do no wrong. So many
   students were behind the team, Tutsie said, that fights at school
   diminished. Burchett, now an assistant to the superintendent, said
   football success influenced achievement in other sports, performing
   arts, and elsewhere.

   "It galvanized a good beginning to that particular year," Burchett
   said.

   There was pressure on the Warriors ahead of the championship game — 20
   consecutive victories, three straight titles, a national ranking — but
   they overran that as they did so many opponents. Finch was in on 10
   tackles, Semiaj Wright intercepted two passes, and defensive end
   Michael Bell blocked a punt to set up a clinching touchdown.

   Afterward, Tutsie was prescient when he asserted that the
   accomplishment would be more special 10 or 12 years later. It could be
   many more years before there is a team worthy to be mentioned in the
   same conversation with '06 Warren Central.

   "It's almost 10 years later, and people are still talking about it,"
   Evans said. "It's really cool being a part of that."

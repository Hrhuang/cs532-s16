'We need him to score'

   West Ham 2-1 Liverpool
   Posted at 22:55 9 Feb

   Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: "We had chances but we didn't score
   goals, I saw a good game from my side. We had big fight, a lot of good
   team tactical things, nice enjoyable performances. But the result is
   not what you want.

   Does Christian Benteke need one to go in? "I don't believe in the easy
   goal. He has to carry on like this. It's not the nicest moment in his
   career but he has to work hard. He wants to score and we need him
   to score. We will work on it in the days, weeks and months."

'It will go down in history'

   West Ham 2-1 Liverpool

   West Ham United
   Posted at 22:44 9 Feb

   West Ham manager Slaven Bilic: "I can explain my feelings, and I can't
   at the same time. It is great, for me a really great game of football.
   It was a classic FA Cup tie. It will go into the history of West Ham's
   greatest games. Liverpool, last season at Upton Park, night kick-off,
   goal in the last minute. And we deserved it, I am very proud of the
   guys. They left their heart on the pitch.

   "The goal came as the cherry on the pie of his [Angelo Ogbonna] game.
   He was magnificent as a centre-half. They made the fans proud of them
   and we want to progress even further. If we produce a performance like
   this then we are capable of beating any team in England."

'We were the better team'

   PA

   Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, speaking to BT Sport: "It’s hard. We
   were the better team, created chances and played good football, but we
   didn’t use them.

   "There were lots of decisions that on a better day I’d say were funny
   decisions. I don’t think it was a free-kick [the decision that led to
   the winning goal] but I’d have to see it again.

   "It’s not easy because we were only here to win. You don’t have to show
   your best, you just have to go to the next round. The door was wide
   open for us because we did well but it was not enough. We have to carry
   on and fight to the next game."

   Upton Park ERUPTS! Brilliant noise greets a wonderful header as West
   Ham surely book a place in the last 16!.

   Dimitri Payet's free-kick delivery from wide on the right is superb,
   centre-back Angelo Ogbonna climbs and batters a header across goal and
   in.

   And now Christian Benteke has an even better chance! Dear me he has to

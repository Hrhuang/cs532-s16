UPDATE: February 8th, 2016 5:00pm

IHR_745pm

UPDATE: February 7th, 2016 10:24pm

   That’s the game!  Congratulations to the Denver Broncos.  So the
   results for the web site performance for advertisers during the game
   are in as well.  Here is the complete list, and as you’ve seen tonight
   while there were some fumbles everyone recovered well…  well except
   Beyonce.com, we are still waiting for it to recover. (edit. look like
   it recovered around 3am).

   [21]Final

   In terms of the top performers Audi.com, Heinz.com and
   MobileStrikeApp.com took the top three spots.   These sites were rock
   solid for the entire game.  This chart below shows the last 4 hours and
   congratulations needs to go out to the web teams responsible for these
   sites.

   Finalists

   Great Game!  Keep checking back with the Dynatrace APM Blog as we go
   through all of these data from this evening and discuss best practices
   for next years advertisers.

UPDATE: February 7th, 2016 9:55pm

   And it looks like the Axe fell on Axe.com (sorry couldn’t resist).  The
   desktop site looks to have had critical issues, however their mobile
   site slowed down but remained up.

   axe

UPDATE: February 7th, 2016 9:50pm

   DeathWishCoffee.com the company that won the Intuit Super Bowl
   Commercial contest had a bit of a rocky ride but it looks like someone
   had a defibrillator and got their site back up in no time.

   deathwish

UPDATE: February 7th, 2016 9:25pm

   Reports on Twitter that Beyonce.com is down.  HTTP 5XX errors usually
   indicate something wrong on the server side.  Read some of our earlier
   updates to under why this happens and what can be done to prevent it.

   [22]beyonce503

   Our tests confirm that this is a server side issue.

   [23]beyonce

   The error message on the page shows a generic NGINX error message.
   NGINX is a web server technology, while this is not Beyonce.com this
   transaction map shows a simple application built on NGINX.  Understand
   what is happening on the server side is critical!

UPDATE: February 7th, 2016 9:00pm

   Jackinthebox.com has offered up a million free hamburgers.

   jack

   Doing this during the Super Bowl results in this (below).  This was
   very ambitious, Looks like the Jackinthebox.com web team pulled it off.

UPDATE: February 7th, 2016 8:30pm

   Here come ColdPlay and crowd.  NFL’s Halftime page is up and running
   fine so far.

   [24]halftime_show

UPDATE: February 7th, 2016 8:25pm

   OK, it’s half time.  There have been a couple of fumbles so far but
   good recoveries by all.  Here is a real time view heading into half
   time.  All the advertisers look like they are up for now.

   [25]halftime

UPDATE: February 7th, 2016 7:55pm

   Did the DrinBai ad air?

   [26]drinkbai

UPDATE: February 7th, 2016 7:50pm

   Dynatrace’s Keynote Internet Health Report is showing more red.  This
   is peering health between backbone carriers.  Overall traffic is high
   this evening so not surprised to see this.   Peering is how traffic
   hops from one carrier to another.   When peering start showing issues
   it can result in slower response time for end users.

   [27]IHR_745pm

UPDATE: February 7th, 2016 7:30pm

   Good job Marmot, not as lethal as we thought.  Quick recovery on a
   pretty serious server side error.

   [28]marmot_backup

UPDATE: February 7th, 2016 7:20pm

   Marmot is starting to have issues.  The Dynatrace Root Cause Analyzer
   is seeing multiple issues but the 503 Error on the root page is pretty
   lethal.  Let’s see if things can get turned around.

   [29]marmot

UPDATE: February 7th, 2016 7:00pm

   30 Minutes since kickoff and the top 3 advertiser sites are still Audi,
   Heinz and “Get to the Choppa…” MobileStrikeApp.  Performance is all
   about optimization.  Great job so far to the web team’s for these
   advertisers.

   [30]Top3

UPDATE: February 7th, 2016 6:30pm

   Moments to Kickoff.  Here is a view of what we are seeing from our
   Desktop and Mobile Website tests.

   [31]DEC_DB_630

UPDATE: February 7th, 2016 6:00pm

   Quickenloans.com is showing some slow DNS activity.  This can usually
   be tweaking at the CDN.  We will keep an eye on things.

   [32]quicken

UPDATE: February 7th, 2016 5:34pm

   OK, Puppy Bowl is back up! Whew.

   [33]puppy_success

UPDATE: February 7th, 2016 5:15pm

   Problems with the Puppy Bowl Site?  Not sure what is going on here but
   Getting initial response from the Puppy Bowl site but no content is
   showing up.

   [34]Puppy

   Seeing the same thing in our local browsers.  We will keep an eye on
   things because… well Puppies are adorable right?

   [35]Puppy_detail

UPDATE: February 7th, 2016 5:00pm

   90 minutes to go before kickoff, here is a view showing a comparison of
   the top performers and the bottom performers.  Those sites which are
   fully optimized for this evening are on average delivering less content
   (byte count), are less complex (fewer round trips for object and
   connection requests) and using fewer third parties (social media, ad
   networks, analytics tools, etc…).

   [36]comparison

UPDATE: February 7th, 2016 4:40pm

   Thankfully it looks like a quick recovery for Mini.com.  Good job by
   the Mini.com web team.

   [37]mini_recovery

UPDATE: February 7th, 2016 4:30pm

   Looks like Mini.com has made a change and it looks like it is impacting
   response times. This might be a pre-game configuration change. [38]Mini

   It could be a pre-game Content Delivery Network change, here we can see
   that some of the remote points of presence and IP addresses are showing
   some pretty wide differences in performance.

   [39]mini_IP

   We hope that things come back around quickly before the game starts.

UPDATE: February 7th, 2016 4:15pm

   Having a quick look at the Digital Experience Dashboards (DEC) and
   dialing in the test resolution and frequency so that we don’t miss
   anything.

   [40]WB_DB_4pm

UPDATE: February 7th, 2016 4:00pm

   Most of our data this evening will be coming from synthetic tests
   (software robots) running real browsers located across the US.  While
   synthetics provides useful information it should always be used in
   combination with real user data when possible.  Below is an example of
   a Dynatrace User Experience Management dashboard showing live data for
   a Fortune 100 US based company.  In this case you can see that the site
   is processing 3,800 requests per minute.

   [41]UEM

   We expect that many of the advertiser sites tonight will experience
   traffic well beyond this.  Understanding real user performance is key
   during live events like Super Bowl Sunday or Black Friday.

UPDATE: February 7th, 2016 3:00pm

   Here is an update as to how some of the media companies are doing
   today.  Leading up to the Super Bowl these sites get a tremendous
   amount of traffic as sport viewers try to keep up to date with last
   minute news.

   [42]media sites

   Kudos so far to the team at CBS.  After some up and down the past
   couple of days the last 12 hours for CBS Sports has been rock solid.
   Great Job guys.

   [43]CBS_3pm

UPDATE: February 7th, 2016 2:30pm

   Checking in with an update from Dynatrace Outage Analyzer.  This is a
   real time view of “collective intelligence” based on every test running
   across the Dynatrace Network.  Here we are looking for current outages
   for third party services used by different websites.

   [44]OA_230pm

   The Dynatrace Keynote Internet Health Report is showing a lot less red
   than we saw yesterday.  Hopefully backbone peering won’t be an issue
   today.

   IHR_230pm

UPDATE: February 7th, 2016 2:00pm

   Today isn’t just about the advertisers, it also about media and other
   sports related sites, like Fantasy Football sites.   Here we can see
   that Fireleague, Fleaflicker and RTSports are all performing grey well.

   [45]fantasy_FB_DB

   We just talked about server side response times in our last update,
   continuing on that theme we wanted to show how an online gaming site
   uses a service like Dynatrace Ruxit to automatically discover “back
   end” services and processes.  Below we can the response times for a
   backend service (notice the increase in response time earlier in the
   week).

   [46]Ruxit_Gaming

   Here we can see some detail around one of the processes this service is
   based on.  Here we can see some network quality issues related to
   packet retransmission causing an issue.

   [47]Ruxit_gaming_issue

   Understanding the interdependencies within applications is one of the
   hard things to do when managing complex applications.  As sites today
   (including many of the advertisers) use elastic computing, often
   organizations have no idea what resource are running at any given time
   let alone which one is causing an issue.  Below is a visualization
   called a SmartScape which shows auto-discovered services and process
   and their relationship with each other.

   [48]ruxit_smartscape

   Tools like Dynatrace Ruxit represent the next generation of intelligent
   APM technology that site owners will need to manage the dynamically
   changing complexity in their applications.

UPDATE: February 7th, 2016 1:20pm

   We’ve been looking at the End User Response Time for the advertiser’s
   sites.  A substantial part of these End User Response Times are made up
   of Server Request Time.  This is how much time it takes a server to
   respond to inbound request from a browser.  We measure this as how much
   time does it take for us to receive the first packet of data in
   response to a request.  Let’s put it this way, this is how much time it
   takes for the server to “think” about responding to a request.

   Server side optimization IS what Dynatrace does.  Speeding server
   response times not only makes for faster end user experience it also
   makes for more efficient use of resources on the server side.
   Optimizing the code which runs on these servers means that fewer
   servers and computing resources are required to handle massive amounts
   of traffic.  Rather than throwing more hardware at an issue, an
   optimized “back end” will mean being able to support higher volume with
   less computer resources.  So a relatively small investment in upfront
   optimization will mean that advertisers can spend much less on
   computing resources to support their sites.

   So let’s look at Server Request Times for the advertisers…

   [49]ServerRequestTime_1pm

   Here we can see that Kia, Colgate and Audi have the fastest server side
   response times for the past 24 hours leading into the SuperBowl.

   Optimizing the server requires specialized understanding as to how all
   the moving parts (applications, services, processes, hosts, methods,
   code, etc…) interact with each other.  The web sites advertiser use are
   incredibly complex and finding performance bottlenecks or application
   issues can be an expensive time consuming process without the right
   tools.

   For example this is what a website can look like from the server side…

   [50]TXN_flowmap

   So when we see advertisers with a 2.39 second server side request time
   we know there is room for improvement as other advertisers only spend
   0.05 seconds on server side request time.

UPDATE: February 7th, 2016 12:40pm

   We have been tracking NFL.com’s Super Bowl page this week and have seen
   some intermittent issues.  Some of the issues point back to NFL.com
   servers however other issues look to be caused by third parties (these
   are things like social media widgets, ad providers, analytics, etc…).

   [51]NFL_1pm

   When we started to look at where some of the content and third party
   service were coming from we saw some interesting things that sites
   owners need to keep on top of.  For example this map is where we are
   monitoring NFL.com from for today’s event.

   [52]NFL_node

   Everything being monitored from locations in the US.  Now below is a
   map showing where responses (content) are coming from.

   [53]NFL_hosts

   Insert “scratch head” icon here.  What would cause this?  This is
   actually not that uncommon. End User’s are often not aware that when
   they load a page in their browser (even if it is for a US site) that
   content could be coming from locations outside the US.  In this case,
   even though we are loading the pages from US locations we are seeing
   that some times responses for content coming from Facebook, Yahoo,
   Google and  ScorecardResearch are coming from non US locations.  Now
   this might be by design or it might be the result of misrouted traffic.
    In any event the, the further away content is from its destination the
   slower that content might become.

   External Synthetic Monitoring is one of the best ways to understand
   when this happening and what the impact on end user experience it has.

Game On!  Welcome to the Live Blog!

   So after months of preparation, anticipation and some incredible
   football it is time to sit back and enjoy the Big Game #SuperBowl50.
   We’ve been blogging about our preparations this week (see below) and
   have been seeing some interesting things.

   We expect that today will (like any good football game) have some high
   points and low points for advertisers.  This Live Blog will go over a
   lot of technical details and we will do our best to translate technical
   metrics to business outcomes.  In the end that’s what this is…

   The Super Bowl is NOT a sporting event, it is a Business and Brand
   event.

   Joe Martin [54]reported that CBS is charging $5 million USD for a 30
   second commercial and that last year the Super Bowl generated 100
   million social mentions.  His study showed that post SuperBowl, brands
   who advertised saw a boost in the stock value.  If that is the case,
   there is a lot at risk today.  The ads themselves have to be creative
   and compelling, however the point of the ads is to promote the brand
   and in today’s business environment the anchor of every brand is a
   businesses web presence.  The $5 million spent on the ad is only a
   fraction of what companies spend on maintaining their web and mobile
   web presence.  That is why we are focusing on each advertiser’s web
   site today.  The goal of the ads is to drive traffic and interest in
   the advertiser’s brand.

   [55]Other studies have shown that 50% of millennials will be watching
   today’s event on more than one device.  Salesforce.com [56]cited a
   study which showed that the 2016 AFC Championship online viewership was
   at record levels with 1.2 million unique viewers watching streams
   online for more than an hour.  We expect that will mean an increase in
   mobile web traffic and we hope that advertisers will have made
   appropriate investment in responsive design techniques to speed the
   performance of mobile web sites.

   So let’s have a look at how things currently stand for the advertisers
   with one of our real time dashboards…

   [57]sb_db_noon

   Based on what we are seeing so far it looks like Audi, Heinz and
   MobileStrikeApp (insert Austrian voice “Get to the choppa” joke
   here) are going to have a good day.

   Keep watch throughout today as we report on live events as they occur.

UPDATE: February 6th, 2016 4:15pm

   Some predictions for tomorrow for some of the advertiser’s websites.
   Unless these sites are planning some big changes in the next 24 hours
   (which can absolutely happen) we expect that Audi.com will be at or
   near the top of the performers.  The site has been highly optimized,
   the page weight (amount of content being delivered) is relatively low,
   the page is not complex (fewer objects and connections or network round
   trips being made) and they are using only one third party from what we
   can see.

   [58]audi_detail

   On the flip side we hope that Fitbit.com does well tomorrow but we are
   seeing some issues which should be addressed.  Based on our experience
   sites like this will be challenged when faced with a  lot of traffic.
   Our waterfall chart shows some of the issues we are seeing with SSL
   times.

   [59]fitbit_waterfall

   A further look with some browser developer tools on their page show
   some other issues.  Most of these look like they are issues with third
   parties, some certificate issues. The browser developer tool (Safari)
   we are using had the debugger stop the page loading for a couple of
   these events.

   [60]fitbit_detail

   Complex pages tend to struggle during high traffic events.  We hope
   things go well for them tomorrow.

UPDATE: February 6th, 2016 2:30pm

   Looking at some of the third parties prepping for tomorrow.  Outage
   Analyzer is seeing some services out with what looks like CDN tuning.

   [61]OA_Saturday

   Dynatrace Keynote Internet Pulse showing a lot of red.  This tracks
   peering at the backbone/carrier level.  Again we hope that this is prep
   activity and we do not see this tomorrow during the big game.

   [62]IHR_Saturday

UPDATE: February 6th, 2016 11:30am

   Updated the advertiser list to include some last minute additions.
   While we can run our tests from ten of thousands of locations world
   wide, for the Big Game we will focusing on 9 locations across the US
   with 5 regions for Real Desktop Browsers using a Chrome profile and 3
   regions for Mobile tests using a Webkit based iPhone6 profile.

   [63]SB50_OPS_Combined

   We will be augmenting the above data with tests running from a Chrome
   Browser from a random selection of over 10,000 locations in real users
   homes and workplaces.  This is called Last Mile monitoring.

   [64]LastMile

   Each time a single test runs from any of locations above (either the
   Backbone, Mobile or Last Mile) our Browsers load the complete page,
   including all the third party content.

   [65]waterfall

   This is a substantial amount of data.  Tools like our real time
   Dashboards and Root Cause Analysis allow us to pinpoint problem areas
   in moments as opposed to to taking hours sifting through various
   screens of data.

UPDATE: February 6th, 2016 1:00am

   You read that right, what are we doing up at 1am?  Websites never
   sleep, so this weekend we won’t either.

   Here is a view of NFL.com over the past 7 days.  Looks like there were
   a couple of performance issues during the past 24-36 hours.

   [66]NFL_060216

   Dynatrace Root Cause Analysis shows the following issues…

   [67]NFL_RCA_060216

   Putting our thinking caps on it looks like some pre-game configuration
   tuning with CDN (Content Delivery Network) partners. Hoping that’s all
   it is and doesn’t show up on Sunday.

UPDATE: February 5th, 2016 3:00pm

   So we are putting the finishing touches on our monitoring Dashboards
   for the weekend.  If you were at the Dynatrace [68]Perform
   Conference this fall you would have seen our Digital Experience Center
   (DEC).  In preparing for the SuperBowl we created a mini-DEC for the
   event.

   [69]dec_dashboard

   This DEC above pulls in data from Dynatrace Synthetic Tests (upper
   left) tracking NFL and related media sites, a custom Google flight
   search widget (lower left), a live Twitter feed for #SuperBowl
   (center), a Google Trends Map widget for SuperBowl related searches
   (upper right) and a link to Outage Analyzer for tracking third party
   outages (lower right).   This view allows us to use multiple sources of
   data in a single pain of glass for tracking a big event.

   [70]ad_dashboard

   In addition the DEC will also be using this dashboard (above) for part
   of our live real time cover during the Super Bowl.  We have live feeds
   for tests hitting both Desktop and Mobile web sites.

   As you can see the tests are up and running, we have comparative data
   coming in.  Here is our first public view of how the #SuperBowl
   advertisers are shaking up.

   [71]ad_ops_dashboard

   We hope the big game will be exciting and the ads entertaining this
   Sunday, but mostly we hope that the advertisers sites are ready for the
   traffic.  There is a lot of investment running on these sites, let see
   if they are up to the challenge.

UPDATE:  February 4th, 2016 10:30Am

   So as I am prepping for monitoring the Big Game (#SuperBowl) this
   weekend I started to run into some issues using Twitter as an indicator
   of when sites may be failing.   Now this is really a unique situation,
   however I imagine that trying to use keywords in social media as
   strategy to monitor #CX and #UX is more common than we think.  We’ve
   scene scenarios where a “C” level or executive VP reads an unkind tweet
   and it starts the snowball rolling.

   In this situation I thought it would be useful to create a widget to
   track occurrences of #SuperBowl and #Crash to see what social media is
   saying about any advertisers sites crashing this weekend.  Choice of
   words is important…

   twittersearch

   So #Crash is clearly not the word to use this weekend, #Fail might be
   but we shall see.  The point here is that Social Media is a great tool,
   however using it to track #CX and UX poses some challenges.

   Ideally what advertisers and site owners should be doing is using some
   sort of solution for tracking real user interactions.  User Experience
   Management or Real User Monitoring is how the industry commonly
   describes what site owners will need this weekend.  This type of tool
   is different from Google Analytics or Omniture as they provide data in
   “Real Time” on every end user visit and every end user interaction
   (meaning every click, touch, swipe, etc…), not just page loads but all
   those client side “asynchronous” events which are used by almost every
   modern site today.

   [72]ruxit_WM

   The view above is from Dynatrace Ruxit.  This view allows a site owner
   to track end user performance and end user activity, but it also tracks
   things like browser or client side errors (JavaScript errors).  These
   are the things which can unexpectedly impact site owners  during events
   like the big game this weekend.

   Understanding when these events are occurring is often a difficult task
   and why more often than not site owners use tools like Social Media to
   tell them when end users are having issues not being detected by their
   server side monitoring.  A good User Experience Management or Real user
   Management tool will automatically detect these events.

   [73]javascript_error

   An even better User Experience Management solution will tell a site
   owner what JavaScript is having an issue, what the issue is, what
   browsers or locales are being impacted and most importantly (this is
   the hard part) who is delivering the JavaScript.  Many times we have
   seen a JavaScript introduced by a third party cause issues and tracking
   down who delivered the JavaScript is a costly time consuming process.

   [74]javascript_error_detail

   Automating the discovery, detection and impact of these events is what
   the industry needs as sites are using more and more third parties.  I
   expect that we will see some sites this weekend be impacted by third
   party javascript issues.  Site owners and advertisers need to keep on
   top of this as looking for Social Media comments for bad #CX and #UX
   alone is a losing strategy.

Original blog post: Prepping for The Big Game 2016 — February 3

   It’s only a couple of days away and the team here at Dynatrace has been
   working hard this week prepping for The Big Game.  We will be having a
   Dynatrace “Performance Bowl” to monitor a variety of websites all
   touched in some way by the wrap up this season’s final game for the
   NFL.  Given the hype and investment being made for this one single
   event all eyes will be on the game and the ads this Sunday.
   Advertisers have to get it right. It won’t be enough to come up with a
   creative ad, they need to make sure that after the ads air that their
   websites can withstand the onslaught of traffic which will follow.
   The Brands in question are investing a lot of money, so there is a lot
   at risk.  Having a website crash after the event can damage a brand and
   potentially waste well-intended advertising dollars.

   The Dynatrace “Performance Bowl” will be tracking the following:
     * NFL websites
     * Ticket websites
     * Team websites
     * Betting/Gaming/Fantasy Football websites
     * Official Broadcaster website
     * Major sports sites

   And of course…
     * Advertiser websites

   We will be tracking these proactively using real browsers running from
   multiple locations across the US and the globe.

   The SD Times just posted a great article
   ([75]http://sdtimes.com/sd-times-blog-touchdowns-in-tech/) about what
   the media and advertisers need to keep in mind.  Like we did last year
   ([76]http://apmblog.dynatrace.com/2015/01/30/super-bowl-ad-performance/
   ), we will be providing a live blog before during and after the game.
   Keep checking in to see how the sites we are tracking are performing.

       Third party campaign requests for campaigns are a reality. A full
       page load based on third party campaign trackers is a bogus state.
       Why don’t you do some real user testing and determine when the site
       is fully functional opposed to fully loaded. All of our third party
       calls are non-blocking calls, meaning we used fiddler to simulate
       and test delay anything outside of apartments.com to ensure our
       user experience was not impacted. I could care less if some
       marketing genius must have some tracker that calls a domain hosted
       in Japan. This isn’t your fathers mobile network, bandwidth to make
       those tcp connects aren’t as expensive as they used to be. Break
       out of your DevOps mindset, fire up fiddler and see how resilient
       sites like apartments.com can be when those third party ad tracking
       calls, are delayed, malformed or 500. The user experience is not
       impacted and our marketing team achieves their goals. We are all
       about performance, all assets from our domain were served up by
       Akamai, with the exception of our non-blocking tracking token we
       use internally. In the end, you can’t say no third party hits on
       Super Bowl Sunday or your campaign is a failure. You can say your
       third party calls are third class citizens and their performance or
       lack of it can be sacrificed for a better user experience.
       I know asynchronous tracing is a newer feature in dynatrace, but
       the model has been around for quite some time.
       Oh and your captcha call timed out…

            Andy, thanks for the response. Sorry for the late reply, it’s
            been crazy busy following up on our Super Bowl results. You
            definitely point out some of the challenges monitoring dozens
            of different sites, each with their own design approaches to
            delivering content. The challenge is finding a metric which is
            consistent across all of the different dimensions we are
            monitoring from. You mentioned… “Why don’t you do some real
            user testing and determine when the site is fully functional
            opposed to fully loaded”. Well, we do, however for an event
            like the Super Bowl it is just not practical for us to place
            “real user” instrumentation on every advertiser’s site. In
            some cases, we simply don’t have relationships with those
            companies to do so, we’d be happy to place some of UEM tags on
            your site next year ;).
            For competitive monitoring we find that driving real browsers
            from remote locations allows us to level the playing field by
            having a consistent set of data from the same locations under
            the same conditions. In terms of the metrics we capture, the
            challenge is that things like W3C Navigation timings are
            interesting but really inconsistent. Also, which metric should
            be used? For example, for your site (apartments.com) I did a
            little comparison. Here is a view showing the DOM Interactive
            time for IE, Firefox and Chrome.
            The challenge is that the browser engine you select really
            changes the results. So if DOM interactive isn’t correct, how
            about DOM Complete?
            Completely different set of results. This is the perennial
            challenge in the industry. There are so many different clients
            which end users have access to. How do you think the results
            would change when looking at Mobile Safari or Chrome or Ice
            Weasel or PS4 Web Browser? Here is a view that I am sure you
            could get access to with your tools showing in a 1 hour period
            all of the different browser families (you’d drill down to see
            the versions) for a site with a lot of traffic.
            When we look at your site, using the “over the wire” response
            times we see much more consistency across browsers.
            But as you point out that includes third party requests which
            may be called after the bulk of the page has rendered. Given
            the limitations in W3C Navigation timings we have been working
            on a Perceived Render Time metric. This metric calculates how
            long does it take the viewable window to appear to an end
            user. We feel that this is a better approach as looking for
            things like “is the page interactive” is not representative of
            end user experience. Many of our customers have been using
            this metric for some time now in our Real User Monitoring
            solution. Here is some more info on that.
            [97]https://community.dynatrace.com/community/display/DOCDT62/
            Perceived+Render+Time
            Next year we can include additional comparisons, so long as
            they are providing consistent responses across as many clients
            as possible. Good luck to your team next year.

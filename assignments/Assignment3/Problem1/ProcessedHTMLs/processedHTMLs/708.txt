   5 Days left: TNW Europe early bird sales end soon. Learn more!

   If you’re excited to try indie development studios Campo Santo and
   Panic’s gripping mystery game [53]Firewatch, you’ll be happy to learn
   that there’s a cool easter egg to look forward to in the PC version.

   There’s a disposable camera somewhere in the forest that lets you snap
   photos in the game world. Once you finish the game, you’ll be able to
   order actual 4×6 prints of your shots to be mailed to you anywhere in
   the world.

   [54]TechnoBuffalo reported that prior to this week’s official launch, a
   set of prints cost $15. and shipped in two to four weeks. The price may
   have gone up since, but if you enjoyed the game, this is as cool a
   memento as you could ever ask for.

   Sadly, the feature isn’t yet available for PlayStation 4 as it requires
   network access and is a bit more complicated to implement for consoles.
   Panic’s [55]Cabel Sasser told Polygon, “We are actively investigating
   what it would take to make this happen on the PlayStation 4. Sony wants
   it and so do we!”

   ➤ [56]In Firewatch on PC, you find a camera – You can have the pics you
   snap physically developed [TechnoBuffalo]

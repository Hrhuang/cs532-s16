Good! But...


   by Cake is yummy!

   There is LOADS of lag! Don't believe me? Well, when I lag, the cell
   will act like a derp and run into bigger cells, when I just wanna get
   away from them! It has a slight delay when you move while lagging, so
   it's really frustrating! Now the PC version is good, and when you lag
   on there, its not a big PC lag spike. On here, thats a different story!
   Those people with OP wifi laughs at the person with horrible wifi as
   they laugh: "Haha! That player is so stupid! They ran into me! They
   must be a noob!" Besides the Lag issues, I recommend a Chat Feature!
   Why not make it so theres a chat button and you have to stop in order
   to chat! You can always turn chat off if it bothers you, but how will
   people communicate? Through nicknames!? You could also have Moderator
   Cells/Spectators, in which they can Mute a person or Ban them for
   "Teaming" or something! How about starting your own Agario Server! You
   could place Viruses anywhere, choose what skins to have, or change the
   rules up a bit! That would be so interesting! For chat you could also
   Censor inappropriate words and mute them if they say another one! If
   Agario has a chat Feature, i'll give it a 4.5/5! And if Chat is added
   or the Lag issue is fixed, i'll give it a 5/5! For now, its a 4... Keep
   up the good work Agario Team! :D

Really? Wimps.


   by T.me.a

   Okay I've read through a lot of these reviews and it's really childish
   how people keep complaining that people are teaming up or the number
   one keeps eating all the people and saying it's "not fair". First of
   all, the whole point is to "win" the game and by doing so, you stay
   number one. When the server "realizes" you've been number one (you have
   to be number one for a long time), it will stop sending people into the
   server or it will send less people into the server. And since its
   ending, less people will be in the server, so number one's job is to
   eat all off them. Since your number one u eat all the people in that
   server and once you eat everyone, it'll just be you and the game will
   reset. That's the whole point in becoming number one. Also it's to
   become the most strongest/ dominate cell. And if you get eaten you'll
   be put into another server. It's no biggie and there's no "actual"
   reward. You don't get money or a new skin, you just have bragging
   rights. I've seen many people become the winner and it is very true.
   I've "won" it multiple times and I'm pretty sure others have "won" and
   it's not a glitch, it means "your time has come". I hope this clears up
   the misunderstanding of it.

Love it,


   by Chef trent

   I found this game in school, it's actually one of the only games we're
   aloud to play, the app is a bit glitchy, but it's still one of my
   favorite time passers, and, one star dudes, what's wrong with you? It's
   still perfect, and, I saw a friend on there, so it can't be automated
   ps-
   The point of the game is to become number one, and kill everyone on the
   map, and the point of the game is also to chase, and be chased, that's
   what makes it s challenge, think of it like this, the way you want it
   would be just you, on the map, no one else, going around eating mass
   for a couple of hours and getting huge, does that sound fun?
   Challenging? No, to answer my own question, it does not, and to the
   matter of teaming, I do it all the time, it's one way to get bigger,
   and another point of the game is to use EVERY advantage you can, like
   splitting virus's into bigger players, I find that to be amusing, with
   the bonus of a lot of mass, I hope you consider this, and have a better
   time playing.

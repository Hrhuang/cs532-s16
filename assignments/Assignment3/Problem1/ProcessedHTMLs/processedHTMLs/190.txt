Second National Day of Action against Sports Direct

13 February - Join us on the day

   Sports Direct Have a Heart Unite will demonstrate outside Sports Direct
   high street stores as part of a second national day of action on 13
   February against Sports Direct’s shameful work practices.

   On this day of action we demand that Sports Direct:

   1.    Commits to becoming a living wage employer
   2.    Tackles its Victorian work practices
   3.    Transfers agency staff onto fixed hour permanent contracts.

   Support Sports Direct workers – join us on the day

   Please join us at a Sports Direct shop near you. If you can’t join us
   in person, then follow us on Twitter [19]@unitetheunion

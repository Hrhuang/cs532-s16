Week in Preview: Rotterdam, Buenos Aires, Memphis, St. Petersburg

   place to get one. (AP)

   [41]The Australian Open hangover period has passed, and February, that
   most modest of months, is upon us. In tennis, the calm comes after the
   storm, as the tours slowly build their way toward March’s big,
   dual-gender events in the United States. For now, the players have gone
   their separate ways again, to indoor hard-court events up north,
   outdoor clay-court events down south, and in the case of the WTA’s
   Taiwan Open, one last lingering tournament in Asia. Here’s a look ahead
   at a busily low-key week.

   *****

ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament (ATP)

   Rotterdam, Netherlands
   $1,781,340; 500 ranking points
   Indoor hard court
   Draw is [42]here

   The week’s most important ATP event doesn’t feel quite as important as
   it usually does. [43]Roger Federer was forced to pull out after having
   knee surgery. The tournament is also missing defending champion Stan
   Wawrinka, 2014 champion Tomas Berdych, and Grigor Dimitrov and Dominic
   Thiem, two entertaining players who have done well here in the
   past. Unfortunately, two entertaining players who are here, Gael
   Monfils and Ernests Gulbis, face each other in the first round.

   Who might take advantage of all these absences and snap up Rotterdam’s
   500 points? [44]Richard Gasquet, [45]winner in Montpelier over the
   weekend, is the top seed; [46]Marin Cilic is the second seed; Gilles
   Simon and David Goffin are third and fourth.

   Returning: 2013 finalist Julien Benneteau

   First-round match to watch: Vasek Pospisil vs. Alexander Zverev

   *****

Argentina Open (ATP)

   Buenos Aires
   $523,470; 250 ranking points
   Clay
   Draw is [47]here

   After his quick exit in Melbourne, [48]Rafael Nadal could use a win,
   and Buenos Aires would seem to be a logical place to get one. The
   tournament was one of three that he won in 2015; now Rafa is back, and
   back on clay, [49]as a wild card and the top seed. He’ll begin against
   either Marco Cecchinato or his friend, Juan Monaco.

   Nadal is not the only name of note in Buenos Aires. While it’s just a
   250, it has lured a few surprising names from up north. The third seed
   is Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, and the fifth seed is Thiem, both of whom have
   played Rotterdam in the past. And while fourth seed John Isner would
   normally be expected to lead the U.S. charge in Memphis this week, the
   big man has opted for South American clay instead. He may regret it if
   he plays Fernando Verdasco in his opener.

   Also here: David Ferrer, Fabio Fognini, Alexandr Dolgopolov, Pablo
   Cuevas

   *****

Memphis Open (ATP)

   Memphis, USA
   $618,030; 250 ranking points
   Indoor hard court
   Draw is [50]here

   In the days when it was a 500-level event, Memphis attracted a
   smattering of highly-ranked players from outside the States. Now that
   it's a 250, that smattering has been reduced to one: defending champion
   [51]Kei Nishikori. Otherwise, this a mostly American affair: Thirteen
   of the tournament’s 28 main-draw players are U.S. natives. This fact
   leads to a few occurrences that you don’t see many other places: Donald
   Young is the third seed and has a first-round bye, 59th-ranked Denis
   Kudla is the fifth seed, and 112th-ranked Ryan Harrison has earned
   a direct acceptance into a main draw.

   In other words, if you like to see American players competing at the
   ATP level, this is the tournament for you. Of particular interest will
   be next-generation kids Frances Tiafoe, Taylor Fritz, Tommy Paul, and
   Michael Mmoh.

   First-round all-American matches to watch: Harrison vs. Tiafoe; Fritz
   vs. Mmoh

   *****

St. Petersburg Ladies Trophy (WTA)

   St. Petersburg, Russia
   $753,000; Premier
   Indoor hard
   Draw is [52]here

   This tournament may have a retrograde name, but it’s a Premier event
   with a sizable purse. It has also attracted a decent field, led by
   top-four seeds [53]Belinda Bencic, Roberta Vinci, Caroline Wozniacki,
   and Ana Ivanovic.

   When it comes to the WTA’s future, many of us started the year on the
   Garbiñe Muguruza bandwagon; but is the 18-year-old Bencic's the more
   reliable ride? After losing in respectable fashion to Maria Sharapova
   in Melbourne, [54]Bencic followed with a three-win performance for
   Switzerland in Fed Cup this weekend. Now she’ll have a chance to show
   what she can do with No. 1-seed expectations on her shoulders.

   *****

Taiwan Open (WTA)

   Kaohsiung, Taiwan
   $500,000; International
   DecoTurf
   Draw is [55]here

   At 35, [56]Venus Williams has shown signs of slowing down on the court,
   but not in her travel schedule. Here she is—after losing in the first
   round in Auckland and Melbourne—still in Asia, still trying to get her
   season started. The top-seeded Williams, who has already fallen five
   spots in the rankings in 2016, will go for her first win of the
   year against wild card Pei-Chi Lee.

   As for the second seed, Misaki Doi, is she still wondering what might
   have been at the Australian Open? She held, and lost, a match point
   against Angelique Kerber in the first round.

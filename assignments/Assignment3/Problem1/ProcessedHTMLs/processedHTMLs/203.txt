   The Maple Leafs' new logo is based more on tradition and history than
   reality, as it doesn't appear to resemble any real leaf according to
   numerous arborists.
   By: [79]Sean Fitz-Gerald Sports Reporter, Published on Thu Feb 04 2016

   To the eyes of several trained arborists, the[80] logo unveiled earlier
   this week by Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment is not, strictly
   speaking, as much Maple Leaf as much as it is Toronto maple-ish.

   The logo revealed Tuesday night is laden with symbolism — including 13
   veins at the top of the leaf to mark the team’s 13 Stanley Cup titles —
   but it does not appear to follow closely to any obvious tree biology.

   “It doesn’t look like any specific leaf, that’s for sure,” said Joe
   Outram, co-ordinator of the arboriculture and urban forestry programs
   at Sir Sandford Fleming College. “But it does resemble some sort of
   cross-breeds between several maple leafs.”

   He suggested the new logo, which will be stitched onto the jerseys next
   season, appears to be a blend of the sugar maple and silver maple
   though there are traces of red maple, as well.

   “You could make an argument that it looks more like a sycamore maple
   leaf,” said Mark Isselhardt, who specializes in the study of maple
   trees at the University of Vermont.

   The new leaf on Toronto’s logo does not look exactly like the leaf from
   a sugar maple, he suggested, because those leaves do not have
   serrations — outcroppings that look like teeth on a handsaw — on their
   lobes (the three main branches rising from the base.)

   “The geometry of it doesn’t really reflect what a leaf would look like,
   regardless of the species,” Isselhardt said. “It just looks a little
   too long and drawn out, oddly pointed.”

   “I will say we did not consult an arborist,” said Shannon Hosford,
   vice-president, marketing and communications with MLSE. “We wanted to
   try and capture the winningest leafs that this club wore between the
   1940s and ’60s, going back to our roots.”

   Carla Antonation, an arborist who co-owns Trilogy Tree Services Ltd. in
   Winnipeg, said that while it is not an exact replica of a maple leaf,
   the new logo is “similar enough that it definitely says ‘Canada.’ ”

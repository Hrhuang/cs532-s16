   We’ve all sat by the phone, waiting for the next text to come in. Your
   last statement just hanging out there. It’s been three minutes, [57]why
   aren’t they responding? Was the joke you made a turnoff?

   This scenario—and the anxiety that comes with it—is common for the
   average dater but also for the average social media manager. Putting
   something out there, only to hear crickets from your audience. Why does
   it happen and how can we change it?

   The truth is, maybe they’re just [58]not that into your brand.

   If you’ve been inundating your audience with mundane, self-promotional
   content while completely ignoring their interests, they’re bound to
   start ignoring and eventually resenting you. According to a [59]U.K.
   study of 2,000 adults, 27 percent of respondents were frustrated that
   social content was either irrelevant or not personalized, and one in
   five found social content annoying when it was too trivial.

   Today’s social interactions lack authenticity, and users are
   increasingly disinterested in what companies have to say online. In
   fact, [60]61 percent of people cite irrelevant content as a
   contributing factor to unfollowing brands on social. Simply put, you’re
   becoming annoying. People won’t care about you if you don’t care about
   them.

   Sending out social messages with the inclusion of random hashtags does
   not define your brand as adept. People find value in and engage with
   content that is highly relevant to them.

   The Three A’s of Social Media Marketing: Appreciate, Analyze, Act

   To captivate social users, it’s essential for brands to create
   meaningful content and messaging that will have a positive effect in
   the long run and stand out amongst the competition.

   1. Appreciate

   Revamping your social media efforts begins with understanding and
   appreciating the complexity of the marketplace. People use social
   networks for varying reasons, and much like the dating scene, people
   have specific interests; some seek entertainment, others information or
   education.

   When marketers recognize and respect why users are turning to social,
   they can develop strategies that leverage the intended outcomes of
   these digital intentions. Success cannot happen until brands
   acknowledge the changing demands that users have.

   2. Analyze

   Many brands are already monitoring what users have to say online.
   However, this needs to be taken a step further with active listening
   practices that improve performance on social. It’s very easy for brands
   to insert themselves into just about any online topic or conversation
   (dating attention-seeker, anyone?), but marketers must be cautious of
   social’s deceivingly ubiquitous nature.

   Users will feel indifferent to erratic interactions and find no value
   in content shared ad nauseam. With in-depth analysis, brands may see
   low performance rates, potential loss of long-term consumer
   relationships and off-putting content overload.

   3. Act

   As marketers consistently analyze social data, it becomes easier to act
   upon campaign inferences. When brands recognize that they are posting
   too frequently, they can start to move away from the philosophy that
   every social interaction needs to be a winner – not every campaign has
   to be a viral success. Marketing teams need to be able to respond to
   user queries and comments in real time, and should be planning social
   media campaigns in months and quarters, not minutes and days.

   The timeliness and speed of social can make long-term strategizing
   difficult, but a brand’s social media presence should never feel
   forced. Marketers can act upon their analysis and begin to create
   constant dialogue around conversations relevant to their products,
   services and industries. After every campaign, brands should repeat the
   sequence of analysis to maintain a fresh perspective.

   No matter the platform, social media efforts need to be a two-way
   dialogue. Brands cannot simply let shoppers talk at them. Rather, they
   need to interact with users, and even seek out opportunities to
   initiate conversations. This should be happening company wide. From top
   to bottom, employee advocacy is a powerful social resource for brands.
   The best social campaigns should not be limited to the marketing
   department.

   By looking at interaction and engagement data, marketers can learn how
   to deploy less content, but at the right time and in the right format.
   Brands should use the speed of social media to immediately engage with
   user queries or feedback. When continually monitoring audience
   responses, brands have the opportunity to pivot marketing strategies
   based on feedback and to further hone their voices to better resonate
   with their audience.

   Marketers can modernize their social presence and engage users with
   valuable content by learning from the past. In 2016, brands should
   never be caught blindsided when consumers ignore their content online.
   Marketers cannot force users to care. However, they can certainly
   encourage interest with a more nuanced understanding of social networks
   and the audience who use them.

Microsoft released a popular video game on the Xbox One — and then took it

       Microsoft briefly made "Red Dead Redemption," an open-world
       adventure game set in the Wild West, backwards compatible with the
       Xbox One, [23]according to Polygon.
       Microsoft [24]has been testing backwards compatibility with Xbox
       games on the Xbox One over the past few months. Backwards
       compatibility means that games made for the Xbox 360, which
       preceded the One, will work without any changes.
       The feature is a big bonus for gamers and encourages people to
       upgrade to the Xbox One, which Microsoft wants.
       "Microsoft tests all Xbox 360 games with our emulator to ensure a
       quality experience across a breadth of titles," said Major Nelson,
       the director of Xbox Live programming, [25]in a comment on Reddit.
       "Due to an error some of the games currently in test were
       accidentally made available."
       Microsoft built an emulator into the Xbox One that lets it run 360
       games, making it easier for developers to include the feature.
       However, there is still an extra level of work required and so it's
       up to publishers and developers to decide if games will be
       backwards compatible.
       A [26]forum post on Microsoft's website asks users to rank which
       games they want next. "Red Dead Redemption" has received over
       129,000 votes, placing it third behind "Skyrim" and "Call of Duty:
       Black Ops."
       Microsoft also accidentally made several other games — "Halo Wars,"
       "Castlevania: Symphony of the Night," and "Tekken Tag Tournament 2"
       — backwards compatible.

Bull for Bull: Pau Gasol to replace Jimmy Butler in All-Star Game

   [96]Jimmy Butler is [97]out of the NBA All-Star Game in Toronto this
   weekend due to a strained knee. Which sucks, because he earned that
   spot, and while the fans didn’t vote him in the coach’s did.

   Butler’s teammate [98]Pau Gasol will replace him.

   NBA Commissioner Adam Silver gets to make the call on a replacement,
   and he stayed in Chicago, but he added a front court player to replace
   a guard. Keeping a Bulls representative might have been part of the
   thinking. The coaches’ votes on replacement players has been weighed in
   the past (Gasol may have been high on that list, coaches love him).
   Also, the East roster has a lot of wings and was light on bigs
   ([99]Andre Drummond, [100]Paul Millsap and [101]Chris Bosh are the only
   real bigs), so this gives coach Tyronn Lue some flexibility up front.

   The East leading Cleveland Cavaliers remain with just one
   representative, [102]LeBron James (voted in by the fans).

   Gasol is averaging 17 points, 10.9 rebounds, and a couple blocks a
   game, and is the only thing close to a consistent performer the Bulls
   have. Besides the injured Butler.

Sacramento Kings to use awesome Arco Arena retro court for six games

   Kings old arena

   Next season, the Kings are moving into a new arena in downtown
   Sacramento, a state of the art building.

   For the team’s six “Friday night flashback” games the rest of this
   season — plus the final contest — the team will play on a retro court
   designed to look almost exactly like the court at the Arco Arena when
   the team first moved to Sacramento in 1985. The court will have the
   Kings logo at center court, the original baby blue framing, and the
   “SACRAMENTO” on the baseline will be in the original font.

   “Our final season at Sleep Train Arena has been filled with
   opportunities to look back at our rich history,” said Kings President
   Chris Granger in a statement. “This court is a special way to salute
   all of the fans, players and coaches who have helped us build toward a
   proud future in Sacramento.”

   While there is always nostalgia, nobody is going to miss Arco/Sleep
   Train that much, it’s one of the more outdated buildings in the league.
   Plus the new arena looks fantastic. But I love this idea to celebrate
   the old look on the way out. Those baby blue uniforms are some of my
   favorite throwbacks.

Report: Dwight Howard and James Harden tried to get the other traded from
Rockets in 2014

   A report earlier this season said [131]Dwight Howard [132]didn’t like
   playing second fiddle to [133]James Harden on the Rockets. [134]Howard
   denied it, but here’s more evidence of the players’ discord.

   [135]Fran Blinebury of NBA.com (hat tip: [136]reddit user Longh0rns):

     Howard and Harden have been an oil-and-water mix since they came
     together for the 2012-13 season. It was only days after [137]Damian
     Lillard‘s 3-point dagger eliminated them in the first round of their
     first playoff series together when both were sending out messages
     and maneuvering to get the other one traded.

     Harden is a difficult teammate to play with, dominating the ball and
     so much of every shot clock and Howard too often felt ignored.

   [Correction: That Rockets-Trail Blazers series occurred in 2014.]

   Plenty could have changed since 2014, and Howard and Harden clicked
   well enough last season to lead the Rockets to the Western Conference
   finals.

   But it’s hard to watch their disharmony – and, by extension, the
   Rockets’ disharmony – this season and believe there are no lingering
   issues. It’s easier to get over those problems when the team is
   winning. When it’s losing, personal issues can be both a cause and
   symptom, snowballing on themselves.

   To whatever extent Howard and Harden are still battling, [138]Harden is
   winning. That’s only logical considering Harden is better, four years
   younger and on a more favorable contract.

   If Howard wants to stay in Houston ([139]he says he does) and play
   without Harden (much more questionable), Howard should have campaigned
   better two years ago.

   For anyone who froze through last year’s All-Star weekend in New York
   and this year’s in Toronto, here’s some good news.

   After heading to [153]Charlotte next year, the All-Star game appears
   likely for another warm destination in 2018.

   Sorry, [154]Cleveland.

   [155]Sam Amick of USA Today:

     According to two people with knowledge of the situation, the NBA and
     Los Angeles officials have made significant progress toward
     finalizing a partnership for the event. The deal is not done, but
     the prospect of All-Star weekend returning to Los Angeles for the
     first time since 2010 is very strong.

     Indianapolis and Miami were also known to be on the league’s short
     list of possible cities for 2018. Sacramento officials had hoped to
     land the 2018 event as a fitting reward for the expected October
     opening of the Kings’ Golden 1 Center in the downtown area, but have
     since shifted their focus to a 2019 bid.

   [156]Chris Haynes of Cleveland.com:

     Sources say the league feels Brooklyn is deserving of its own
     All-Star Weekend in the near future since it shared the event with
     New York in 2015.

   Toronto and New York are excellent cities.

   In February, though, Los Angeles is an upgrade.

   The Nets reportedly interviewed Sean Marks twice for their
   general-managing vacancy. Then, they reportedly [167]offered him the
   job.

   But with Marks reportedly [168]leaning toward rejecting it, Nets owner
   Mikhail Prokhorov [169]says no offer has been made and he needs another
   week.

   If extending this search past the trade deadline weren’t embarrassing
   enough, Prokhorov digs his hole even deeper.

   Andy Vasquez of The Record:

     When asked specifically about Sean Marks, Prokhorov said: "I have
     never heard this name before."

     — Andy Vasquez (@andy_vasquez) [170]February 17, 2016

   Prokhorov is either clueless or outrageously bitter. The latter is far
   more likely, but either look tarnishes him more than anyone else.

   I think we can safely assume Marks is out of the running. The next
   question: Will this make any other candidates leery of taking the job?

   (Byfield MA) North Reading survived four lead changes in the final
   quarter and defeated Triton, 60-56, on Wednesday night Cape Ann League
   action.

   The Hornets (7-8) had a very slim, 55-54 lead with 1:12 left but
   capitalized on a Viking rebounding foul (Luke Reineiger) and a
   converted offensive rebound (Adam Goldstein) and put five straight
   points together to win the game.

   Triton (7-9) got down early (22-9) as Derek Hogan (18 points) carried
   North Reading.

   Later the Vikings would erase a 30-20 deficit with a 17-1 run that gave
   the home team a 37-31 lead with three minutes left in the third
   quarter. Nick Venora (19 points) tallied nine points in a lengthy
   stretch of solid offense and defense.

   Cam Armand started the final quarter with a three to get Triton up by
   four (44-40).

   The key to the North Reading win? Twice in the last quarter the Hornets
   turned misses into point-producing offensive rebounds. The first time
   it happened senior Gerard Walsh punished Triton with a three after a
   teammate rebounded Gerard’s missed free throw to get NR ahead, 52-48.
   Later it was Adam Goldstein (12 points) converting a missed free throw
   into two points with a rebound to increase the Hornets’ lead to 58-54
   with fifty-four seconds to go.

   The Vikings opted for the quick fix 3-point attempts but came up empty
   on all three tries down the stretch.

   North Reading won despite twenty turnovers and thirteen (10-for-23)
   missed free throws. The Hornets miscued on eight freebies in the final
   quarter.

   The Vikings had a very cold shooting night from the field. They did
   make four 3’s but needed several more in this one.

   North Reading won the first match between the two teams in December,
   62-40. Adam Goldstein had 21 points in that NR victory.

   The Hornets ended a two-game losing streak. They play Notre Dame Cristo
   Rey (Lawrence) on Thursday and at undefeated Hamilton-Wenham on Friday.

   Hamilton-Wenham routed Triton by thirty-nine points on Friday. Marcus
   Zegarowski had thirty-one points in that one. HW had only won the
   previous meeting between the two teams, 51-44, in December.

   The Vikings will be at Masco on Friday night.

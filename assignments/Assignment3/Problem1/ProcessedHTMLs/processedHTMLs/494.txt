   ISIS Child Soldiers In Syria Play A Sickening Game Of ‘Hide and Seek’

   Warning: This article contains footage that you may find distressing.

   ISIS have published a disgraceful video in which child soldiers play a
   sick game of hide and seek. They are given a gun and a balaclava and
   told to execute prisoners who have dared to defy the twisted militant
   groups ideology.

   The video was shot in an ancient castle in a remote part of Syria. It
   shows the six recruits running through the historic ruins in search of
   the hidden prisoners. They are tied up, unable to move and are forced
   to wait for the children (who look no older than eight) to shoot them
   with a pistol at close range.

   Here the children study the Koran and are brainwashed into believing
   ISIS’s distorted interpretation of it.

   The prisoners are described as ‘sons of jews’ and are accused of spying
   for the Assad government. They are completely helpless as the children
   search them out.

   It’s hard to find the words to describe this truly abhorrent video. I
   cannot comprehend how anyone could brainwash an innocent child into
   committing this kind of atrocity. It goes without saying that the
   clip below includes some incredibly disturbing images:

   The West have stepped up their offensive against ISIS in the wake of
   the Paris attacks. We can only hope that the air strikes start to take
   effect. Any regime that forces its children into this kind of action
   needs to be destroyed, whatever the cost may be.

   Fruit bar brand That’s It is launching two new ranges - Zesty and Bites
   - designed to meet the flavor and health demands of Millennials.

   Rolling out in the next few months, the Zesty range comprises three
   bars - apple, pear and ginger; apple and cinnamon; and apple, mango and
   chili. In line with rest of the That’s It range, all have only two or
   three ingredients.

   “Where we are really ahead of the curve is in using clean and simple
   ingredients that people can pronounce,” CEO and founder Lior
   Lewensztain told BakeryAndSnacks. “We don’t use any concentrate that
   has sugars built in, and we use 100% real fruit.”

Fruit-on-the-go package

   He added that the brand's bars are, essentially, a delivery system for
   fruit. “It’s fruit in the on-the-go package,” he said.

   The Bites range, meanwhile, is designed for consumers who don’t want to
   eat a whole bar at once, and is packaged as single-serve pouches
   containing five snack 'Bites'. Each Bite is a mix of fruit and dark
   chocolate, with the whole pouch containing 150 calories.

   The dark chocolate in That’s It Bites has only three ingredients,
   which Lewensztain said was almost unheard of.

   That's It displays their latest Zesty and Bites lines at this year's
   Winter Fancy Food Show

   "Most chocolate has between five and 15 ingredients,” he added. “The
   product, in total, has less than five ingredients. It’s very
   fruit-centric, but we add a little bit of dark chocolate to satisfy a
   sweet tooth.”

   All That’s It ingredients are naturally sourced, and Lewensztain said
   he was hoping to obtain organic certification next year

   “We don’t want to say we are only a certain percentage organic," he
   added. "We want to say we are either 100%, or until then, we are ‘all
   natural’.”

New flavors but same focus

   Zesty and Bites will launch in the next a couple of months, and the
   That’s It R&D team is developing new products to bring to market over
   the course of the year.

   The company plans to stick with its current bars and bites format and
   focus its innovation on new flavors, said Lewensztain, adding that
   introducing a new fruit required a lot of testing to ensure it is well
   received by consumers.

   “Fruit is a staple in every culture, and I think fruit bars play a huge
   role in the snack industry,” he said. “It’s a great alternative for
   people to eat their fruit for the day, while still being able to snack
   and be healthy.”

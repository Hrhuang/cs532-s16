Ingredients

   Servings: 4___________________
     * 2 Slice ginger
     * 12 chicken wings, just the middle section
     * 2 Teaspoon cooking oil
     * .5 Cup dark soy sauce
     * 1 12-ounce can of Coca-Cola

Preparation

     * Total Time:

   35 min

     Prep Time:
   5 min

     Cook Time:
   30 min
    1. Heat a small-medium sized pot, add the oil and ginger. When the oil
       is hot, brown the wings on both sides. Do this in batches if
       necessary. When all the wings are browned, take out the ginger, and
       add the soy sauce and Coke into the pot. Bring to a boil, then turn
       to medium/low-medium heat and simmer for about 30 minutes or until
       meat falls of the bone easily. Taste the sauce to see if it is
       needs more soy sauce. If not, turn heat back on high for a few
       minutes to let the sauce thicken. Make sure the wings are covered
       with the Coke/soy sauce mixture. Add more sauce according to taste.
       Serve.

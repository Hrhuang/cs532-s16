      <div style="clear:both;"></div>"One of these nights I may just jump down that rainbow way, be with my baby..." &nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjvCGFptxgI" target="_blank">TVC15</a><br />
<br />
I used to keep a picture of David Bowie beneath my bed. &nbsp;What?, it's true. &nbsp;Sort of. &nbsp;My "bed" was the two benches and a table that folded down in the front of a little camper trailer. &nbsp;The picture was actually a scratchy vinyl copy of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Station_to_Station" target="_blank">Station to Station</a></i> that my cousin had acquired somehow &amp; couldn't sell. &nbsp;This was in the mountains North of San Bernardino. &nbsp;I'd been uprooted &amp; displaced. &nbsp;I was West Coast without a compass. &nbsp;Alien.<br />
<br />
I used to think David Bowie was my mom's music. &nbsp;Except, in the radio Eighties he became my music, in a way that the other "classic rock" guys who were still going couldn't manage. &nbsp;I wasn't a fan of the high-waisted pastel Serious Moonlight look, but it's a miracle I never got a tear tattooed next to my eye. &nbsp;Such is the power. &nbsp;He has always been there, the cool Uncle who knows what you're into before you do. &nbsp;You want to grow up to be just like him. &nbsp;And marry him, too, somehow. &nbsp;Marry your cool Uncle twin.<br />
<br />
I could never listen to that record, but I still have it. &nbsp;I wouldn't have been able to appreciate the melodrama &amp; depth of it back then, anyway. &nbsp;Later years would find me driving dizzy, trying to sing along on lonely trips to Joplin &amp; back. &nbsp;The road only existing as far as my headlights. &nbsp;If an asteroid were going to hit the Earth, I wanted to go out listening to this album. &nbsp;So perhaps it is inevitable that I would link <i>Station to Station</i> to [Blackstar]. &nbsp;Maybe nothing more than my own emotional connection, but they seem similarly structured, "difficult", and then there's David Bowie miming at the end of the "Lazarus" video, wearing the same diagonally-chalkstriped outfit his younger self is wearing on the back of my cd. &nbsp;Just part of the mystery he has left us.<br />
<br />
Speaking of leaving us--I am amazed at how he pulled off such a grand exit. &nbsp;I can't even manage to scare up the skeleton of a will. &nbsp;The more I think about it, the more at a loss for words I become. &nbsp;It's a record I knew he could make, without my being able to imagine what it would sound like. &nbsp;There is no pop-connection, no effort for one last hit. &nbsp;It has the surreal energy of later Scott Walker without sounding like a rip off. &nbsp;Sometimes the music &amp; vocals could be two different songs. &nbsp;The music just goes. &nbsp;There's a little pattern the saxophone repeats about three &amp; a half minutes into "’Tis a Pity She Was a Whore", getting a little higher pitched each time, until it breaks free &amp; takes me with it. &nbsp;Scrutinizing the lyrics, though, can be overwhelming. &nbsp;In their own way, they end up being as wild as the jazz behind them. &nbsp;Seriously, an entire song sung in Polari &amp; Nadsat. &nbsp;I'll still be deciphering it next year. &nbsp;Anyway, there are numerous reviews &amp; articles that say this better than I can.<br />
<br />
A couple days ago, when I had [Blackstar] on repeat &amp; had no idea what news Monday would bring, I kept asking "what is human?", and a lyric that jumped out at me was "endless faith in hopeless deeds". &nbsp;That answer works for me. &nbsp;Maybe it's that suspension of disbelief that allows love &amp; art to thrive.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <p>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>The cold feels like I've moved to Siberia. &nbsp;Every dark morning last week, I drove to work with Godflesh cranked to 13 (naturally). &nbsp;There's an unrelenting, funky pulse that often (re)animates the angry sludge of these songs. &nbsp;One of my favorites is the unfortunately-titled "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9RaTOTWUVA" target="_blank">Circle of Shit</a>". &nbsp;The dance it makes me do is like a film loop of Grover from Sesame Street having an epileptic fit.<br />
<br />
The stew of the week: &nbsp;Godflesh, David Bowie, <i>The Hateful Eight</i>, <i><a href="http://comicbookroundup.com/comic-books/reviews/avatar-press/providence" target="_blank">Providence</a></i>, <i><a href="https://imagecomics.com/comics/releases/nameless-1" target="_blank">Nameless</a></i>, my own weird dreams, the "news" of the world, all bubbling in the mix. &nbsp;<i>Space Oddity</i> through <i>Ziggy</i>, anticipating [Blackstar]. &nbsp;Dialogue &amp; death in a widescreen blizzard. &nbsp;Madness induced by unpronounceable Lovecraftian demons. &nbsp;All preferable to another day at the Skin Factory. &nbsp;My job is turning me into an asshole.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://chaishaikc.com/" target="_blank">Chai Shai</a> &amp; <a href="https://drafthouse.com/kansas-city" target="_blank">Alamo Drafthouse</a> with JMC. &nbsp;An unhurried pakora curry with a mysterious salty, pickled, stemmed lump that I should ask for two of next time. &nbsp;A 20-something woman to my right baby-talking to her boyfriend throughout their meal. &nbsp;I took a deep breath &amp; imagined she was a Manga character. &nbsp;The couple who replaced them held hands &amp; prayed out loud over their food, then commenced an "honest" conversation about their relationship. &nbsp;They seemed to be new to each other. &nbsp;I was struck by how beautifully cultish their public praying was to me. &nbsp;I think I've finally gotten over the childhood trauma of Midwestern cross-wielding psychos, and I can accept Christianity as being just as valid as any other religion.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed <i>The Hateful Eight</i> as much as any Tarantino film. &nbsp;I have a sort of pact with the ghost of a friend, this is what I'd be doing if you were still here. &nbsp;But amidst all the casual elbows-to-the-face, human beings reduced to splattered gore, and copious use of the word "nigger", I have to ask myself why. &nbsp;Especially, when a young black man is setting my beer down in front of me at the exact moment the word is eliciting laughter from the audience. &nbsp;I was mortified &amp; felt like running from the theater, screaming "black lives matter!" &nbsp;I want art to provoke an emotional response, questioning, reevaluation, etc., so...there you go, am I part of the problem or the solution, or both? &nbsp;The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdlMXLPfGh4" target="_blank">score</a> is good. &nbsp;The bit with the door is hilarious. &nbsp;I like how "pocket universe" it all seems--three hours of these characters isolated by a blizzard in a shack in Wyoming. &nbsp;The closeness of it makes me think of Sartre's <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Exit" target="_blank">No Exit</a></i>.<br />
<br />
"What is human?" &nbsp;It's a question that repeats in issue four of <i>Nameless</i>. &nbsp;As the demon/alien takes away limbs, eyes, sex, dignity; &nbsp;as it drives people to rape &amp; murder; &nbsp;as our bodies are digested &amp; become worms' bodies. "What is human?" as I read of a certain "presidential candidate" urging his supporters to strip protesters of their coats before throwing them out in the cold. Seeing his claim that he's a victim of hatred, rather than an instigator, I feel the disgust grow in me, knowing he's going to get away with it. &nbsp;"What is human?" as North Korea pretends (or not) to have a hydrogen bomb, and daily shootings have made going to a restaurant an act of courage. &nbsp;The terrorists &amp; Trumpies are a cancer popping up on an overpopulated, polluted Earth where all the resources are being perverted &amp; misappropriated by a handful of people. &nbsp;Every time I turn on the news, I think "gotta make way for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBQ-S6njQQw" target="_blank">Homo Superior</a>!"<br />
<br />
On the flip side, Berkley Breathed's new <i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/berkeleybreathed" target="_blank">Bloom County</a></i> is a wondrous thing. &nbsp;Neil Gaiman's <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BAQso4sP4Vq/?taken-by=neilhimself" target="_blank">baby</a> is super cute. &nbsp;And a flock of starlings are squabbling on my lawn, sounding like rain when they all take off at once.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

<br />
It's quiet here in the Summer, relatively so. &nbsp;When "the students are in town" there appears to be a highway three blocks from me, which I guess is true: &nbsp;a highway that becomes a regular road while passing through &amp; turns back into a highway as it wanders West. &nbsp;There's a constant rumble of traffic that makes me think of Montag hobbling across the street in Fahrenheit 451. &nbsp;It bewilders me that so many people would be out driving in the evening. &nbsp;But tonight the cars are isolated. &nbsp;They punctuate the sound of the neighbor's air unit, a dog barking, tree frogs. <br />
Lately, I've been hearing what the Great Internet tells me is a Barred Owl: &nbsp;hoo-hoo-hoo-hoowurrl. &nbsp;It's pretty cool, if you aren't a squirrel or a rabbit. &nbsp;I stand in the back yard, watching a single bat looping across the dimming sky, wishing it would help itself to the mosquitoes trying to land on my face. &nbsp;The air is humid, but not enough to draw out more than a few lightning bugs. &nbsp;Imagine if a part of your body were to phosphoresce in relation to your desire for company. &nbsp;Would we view lonely people as beautiful, or freakish? &nbsp;How many people never meet because we can't see each other glowing? <br />
The dark treetops are barely moving, framing a smudge of cloud like something badly erased. &nbsp;I feel a sort of suspension of time, which I long for, but which also frightens me. &nbsp;We created the clock &amp; calendar. &nbsp;We sized up &amp; marked off our lives in days and hours &amp; grains of sand. &nbsp;But what happens to time when you aren't expected to be anywhere or do anything, when your main activity is to breathe in &amp; breathe out? &nbsp;If you halve the distance between two points, then halve the new distance, and again, again, etc., the two points will always get closer, but never touch because <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt3eEBKa_no" target="_blank">the space between</a> is only ever partially closed. &nbsp;The half leaves a hole, so to speak. &nbsp;And so, this moment. &nbsp;Inhaling the night, seconds into milliseconds into micro- into nano-...an eternal existence in the gully of a Temporal Grand Canyon. &nbsp;I don't want my life to be ticking clocks, but water flowing over mossy rocks. <br />
Getting older seems to be a weird combination of accretion &amp; erosion. &nbsp;I'm wearing out skins before I ever get comfortable in them. &nbsp;I'm dragging around a few barnacled husks, looking for a talented tailor. &nbsp;"Oi, Savile Row! &nbsp;'Ow much for a metaphysical niptuck?" &nbsp;"Erm...Sir, is this a Monkee or a Bunnyman?" <br />
I have a recurring dream-situation, in which I'm driving a car, but there's always a problem--I'm in the back or passenger seat, straining to operate the pedals, I'm driving backwards, the road is so steep the car goes airborne. &nbsp;It's comically obvious I feel I'm bungling this journey. &nbsp;But I'm suddenly curious what my dream metaphor was before I had my license. &nbsp;Or maybe becoming a driver in real life symbolized an adult phase I was never ready for and it created a crisis. &nbsp;In which case, thanks to all of you who guilted me into getting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04ZIj4r6jx8" target="_blank">behind the wheel</a>.<br />

      <p>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div><div style="text-align: left;">
I can't believe in 2015. &nbsp;2001 will always be the future. &nbsp;Everything since has been a scam, 365 scraps stitched together &amp; painted in Seasonal colors, each copy becoming less defined, falling apart, burning up at an alarming rate.</div>
<br />
<div style="text-align: left;">
Google-roving the streets between Shoreditch &amp; Hoxton, I kept thinking, "a one room flat in Hackney...a one room flat in Hackney?..." &nbsp;Ohhh, there you are--<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HFkimK9FAU" target="_blank">Robyn Hitchcock</a> on a tape deck in 1988, ghost-whispering from the virtual reality of my lost future. &nbsp;We were in a parking lot in Diamond. &nbsp;Or Granby. &nbsp;Looking for thrift stores &amp; flea markets in little towns outside Joplin. &nbsp;Sarcoxie. &nbsp;Racine. &nbsp;I couldn't point you in their direction. &nbsp;All those names spun around my corner of Missouri like a roulette wheel. &nbsp;Anderson. &nbsp;Seneca. &nbsp;Our marble landed on faded black, tarred cracks, and a place that might have once sold Western wear, brown paint peeling.</div>
SP: &nbsp;You didn't tell me there was saxophone.<br />
Me: &nbsp;There usually isn't. &nbsp;But that's why I brought this one.<br />
She listened with her eyes on the dashboard, quickly losing interest. &nbsp;I never could get anyone to bite that earworm &amp; there was entirely too much sun in the sky for our alternative layers. &nbsp;Google-roving through my own memories, eavesdropping on a couple of overdressed teens in a Honda. &nbsp;The girl looks irritated. &nbsp;The boy looks depressed. &nbsp;She is searching for something. &nbsp;He's along for the ride. &nbsp;Always the passenger. &nbsp;"I think my mom's mom was born here." &nbsp;Did he say that, or did I?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
There are unexplained gaps in my post-Y2K journaling. &nbsp;I supposedly moved from Joplin. &nbsp;Three hours of Bjork's "Vespertine" on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YkTE3vVwp4&amp;list=PL1BCBDDA394C775C9&amp;index=5" target="_blank">repeat</a>, following red taillights into a chilly evening. &nbsp;Terrorists hit New York, and the murderous buffoons have been proliferating in the cracks of the world like mold in a cheese. &nbsp;In "2013", a wanna-be Banksy poster is peeling on a brick wall along Regent's Canal, Mickey Mouse in a gas mask, "Fight the rich, not their wars".<br />
<br />
Early 1987, a snow-covered chat pile in Carterville &amp; a quiet black-haired kid. &nbsp;I really don't want to be out in this cold, but if we share a sled, he might have to put his arms around me. &nbsp;Ten years later, I'm standing at the window of a dark, unoccupied train car somewhere in Serbia. &nbsp;Warm air whips the curtains, the moon reflecting in random patches of water, and I've never been so far from home.<br />
<br />
I burrowed into a hole of an apartment, emerging long enough to be saddled with a house &amp; lose my best friend. &nbsp;2008 gets a gold star. &nbsp;Gin hallucinations in the back yard, mind-numbing cicada scree, fireflies cauterizing the humid night. &nbsp;2009, 2010, the morning glories dwindled as the roses took over. &nbsp;2011, the garden is gone, two cats in the ground, a multiple-vortex slug erases almost a quarter of Joplin.<br />
<br />
I thought I could let go. &nbsp;Maybe I did. &nbsp;As jets left trails of coloured smoke above the Thames. &nbsp;As I felt myself dissolving in the shadows of Notre Dame. &nbsp;As I shivered with LB in the early morning at a rural Gascogne train station. &nbsp;Maybe I opened the cartoon cage of my chest and that bird darted away with the crows in the dark pine.<br />
<br />
(...2013, 2014...)<br />
<br />
Late 70s, sunny California, outside the shower at a camp for fruit pickers: <br />
You: &nbsp;"I'm running away. &nbsp;Don't tell anyone." &nbsp;Sweat-dampened hair. &nbsp;Freckles. &nbsp;Bicycle. <br />
Me: &nbsp;"We're leaving today. &nbsp;I wish you could come with us." &nbsp;That last part unsaid or unheard.<br />
Marina Tsvetaeva: “What is this gypsy passion for separation, this readiness to rush off when we've just met?"<br />
I imagine I met you again, years later in Needles. &nbsp;You didn't recognize me, but your smile was the same. &nbsp;Already rusting in the desert, the city became a ghost town when you left. &nbsp;I pulled my jacket closer &amp; something pale circled me as I tried to write by the stars.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>I don't know where my head was at last night. &nbsp;I dreamed I was downtown with someone, and while they were busy, I went into a high-end boutique looking for pants. &nbsp;The woman working there brought me a pair of Tommy Hilfiger jeans that had a strip of faux patching down the side of one leg. &nbsp;Before I could express to her how much I hate that type of thing &amp; do you have a nice corduroy or velvet trouser, she said I needed some matching shorts, and lead me into another room. &nbsp;Except we went through yet another door, into a crowded room that appeared to be a hidden bar full of hipster junkies having a slumber party. &nbsp;She made out with several people as we passed through to a wooden picnic table against a wall. &nbsp;I saw her take a pill with a heart printed on it, and when I asked her what it was, she said something very vulgar about preparing herself for an act she expected we were about to do, then she mimed it to a chick sitting nearby and they cackled. &nbsp;I let her know she was definitely barking up the wrong tree, and made my exit. <br />
It was night &amp; I was in a residential neighborhood. &nbsp;I walked down the street, singing a cannily accurate rendition of Tom Wait's "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC3__wH10Pw" target="_blank">Jitterbug Boy</a>", until I came to a house that looked like an explosion had blown the front of it out. &nbsp;It wasn't my house, but I noticed a bunch of my stuff in the wreckage. &nbsp;It suddenly seemed like a dangerous place to be, so I started sneaking back the way I came. &nbsp;I hid behind a bush as a car idled past &amp; a voice yelled, "Yo mama went to the phar-ma-cee!" &nbsp;The place I'd left was now an old house with tar paper shingles and I could hear Petey in the back yard wanting to be let in. &nbsp;As I went through the house, I could see red &amp; blue lights flashing on the windows, where a policeman had pulled a guy over. &nbsp;From the back porch I saw a different guy covering my car in political campaign stickers. &nbsp;A group of kids came along and said my car should be moved, so the guy started pushing it. &nbsp;He lost control &amp; it ran up over the curb with a loud crunch/pop. &nbsp;I yelled at him &amp; told the policeman he was a witness, that the guy had to replace my car. &nbsp;He gave me a put-out look and took off his shirt, like he didn't have to deal with it if he wasn't in uniform.<br />
That's how I dream.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Standing at the back door, squinting in the sun, I somehow smell wood smoke &amp; mint. &nbsp;If anyone sees me, I must look high, but it's just that I'm not wearing my glasses. &nbsp;Beyond the patio, the yard starts to blur. &nbsp;The next street over is suburban Monet. &nbsp;There's an absurdly loud cardinal in a mulberry tree--bobbing red smudge, grey branches cross-hatching pale blue that hasn't yet deepened into a proper sky. &nbsp;This tree is entangled in a thick type of vine that, by Summer, will cover it over with it's own leaves, weighing it down, warping it into a wind-bent pose. &nbsp;It's part of the reason my garden corner has become Shady Compost Corner for the past five years. &nbsp;Poke and morning glories seem to like it. &nbsp;Actually, the patio is an area of large purple-red bricks overrun by ivy from the South and honeysuckle from the North. &nbsp;The furniture is verdigrised and lacquered by seasonal particulate. &nbsp;It looks like nobody lives here. &nbsp;Sometimes I wonder if anybody does. &nbsp;"Aww, Shane just stepped in a big pile of Emo!" <br />
Yeah, ok. &nbsp;But that wave of adult self-sufficiency I was surfing has turned into a backwater lagoon. &nbsp;I don't want to wash my dishes, I don't want a job, I don't want to drive a car, and I really don't want someone else taking care of me. &nbsp;I find no joy in that. <br />
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_CMSzseAtQ" target="_blank">Roy Montgomery</a>'s guitar sirens down the hall behind me &amp; I look forward to those humid nights when it sounds like the trees are singing to each other. &nbsp;Terrorists, idiots and malcontents are ruining the idea of travelling for me, but if I had the money, I might risk a plane to New Zealand and stay there. &nbsp;Until then, there's always Google. &nbsp;One of my favorite things is when I'm doing some virtual hiking around London, I turn down a little side street, and suddenly it's 2008--the weather changes, the past six years of construction blinks away &amp; old buildings or vacant lots appear. &nbsp;I imagine these time pockets exist all around us, if only we knew the right words.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

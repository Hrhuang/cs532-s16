      <p class="bio">The buzz: Finally…Social Selling has grabbed business headlines since at least 2012, with companies worldwide hanging onto every word of advice from a handful of Social Selling gurus. It’s time to peek behind the curtain and find out if Social Selling is a proven cure-all for old-school, impersonal, annoying cold-calling, and if its best practices are set in stone or still evolving. We’re asking three thought leaders to tell us once and for all if Social Selling is fantasy and hype or fix and hope. The experts speak. Kurt Shaver, The Sales Foundry: “The first thing you should do as a Social Seller is enhance your LinkedIn profile… create a good impression before jumping in.”  Jim Fields, SAP: “The term ‘Social Selling’ is actually a bad name for what we are talking about.”  Kirsten Boileau, SAP: “Sales can’t do Social Selling without Marketing, and Marketing can’t do Social Selling without Sales."  Join us for Social Selling: Fantasy or Fix, Hype or Hope? Three Experts Speak.</p>

      Football Game at SMU Moved to Friday Night
      Horned Frogs to play in Dallas on Sept. 23
      Feb. 9, 2016


      DALLAS -- TCU's football game this coming season at SMU has been moved
      from Saturday, Sept. 24, to Friday, Sept. 23, with the contest
      televised on ESPN. The kickoff time is TBA.

      The Horned Frogs will now have two Friday games in the 2016 campaign.
      Last week, TCU's game at Texas was moved to Black Friday, Nov. 25.

      SMU will be TCU's first road game of the season. The Horned Frogs open
      the campaign with consecutive home dates versus South Dakota State
      (Sept. 3), Arkansas (Sept. 10) and Iowa State (Sept. 17).

      TCU has won its last four games with SMU, eight of the last nine and 14
      of 16.

   The Blues close out a three-game homestand tonight against the Jets at
   Scottrade Center.  They've split the first two, losing to San Jose and
   beating Minnesota.  The Blues are third in the Central Division. The
   Blues won't have the Alex Pietrangelo for a while.  He's been placed on
   injured reserve after hurting his right knee in Saturday's game against
   Minnesota.  Pietrangelo will be re-evaluated in three weeks.  He has
   three goals and 20 assists this season.

   Spring training for the Cardinals is creeping closer.  Pitchers and
   catchers are due to report in Jupiter one week from tomorrow, with the
   first official workout set for February 18th.  Position players arrive
   on February 23rd, with the first full-squad workout slated the next
   day.

   Bills running back LeSean McCoy was involved in an incident early
   Sunday morning in Philly that left two off-duty police officers in the
   hospital.  It happened around 2:30 a.m. at a place called the Recess
   Lounge. It was there that McCoy, and a friend, were involved in a
   physical altercation with the two officers. Sources also say that while
   McCoy and his friend were not arrested, they are the focus of the
   investigation. Meanwhile, one report says that four NFL players got
   into a brawl with off-duty police officers in Philadelphia. We will
   have to see how Philly cops and the NFL handle this.

   Former top overall Major League Baseball draft pick Delmon Young is
   facing battery charges after allegedly choking and threatening to kill
   a valet attendant.  Multiple reports say Young became violent when the
   attendant denied him access to a hotel elevator.  The 30-year-old fled
   the scene to his apartment and, according to a police report, greeted
   officers naked from the waist down.  Young was arrested in 2012 and
   pled guilty to aggravated harassment for yelling anti-Semitic slurs
   while drunk in New York City.  He was suspended for seven days by MLB
   and ordered to undergo counseling.  Young also was suspended 50 games
   for throwing a bat at an umpire during a minor league game in 2006.  He
   played 52 games for Baltimore last year, batting 270 with two home
   runs.

   An affidavit is outlining Cleveland Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel
   beating, restraining and threatening to kill his ex-girlfriend.  The
   girlfriend has requested a protective order against Manziel.  She says
   the former Heisman Trophy winner kept her from leaving his hotel room
   and slapped her so hard she lost hearing in one ear.  Manziel also
   allegedly pulled her by the hair and told her QUOTE "Shut up or I'll
   kill us both."  The request for the restraining order was granted and
   Manziel is required to stay away for two years.  Dallas police continue
   to investigate the January 29th incident.  The Browns are expected to
   cut Manziel in March when the new NFL year begins.

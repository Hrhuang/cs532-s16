   Lindsey Parnaby/AFP/Getty Images Fans React To Football Ticket Price
   Rises
   Fans fury: Liverpool fans hold a banner as they protest against the
   recently announced rise in ticket prices

   As the banners held up at [129]Anfield last weekend said: “Football
   without fans is nothing”.

   Full credit must go to the Liverpool supporters who walked out of the
   game against for Sunderland for putting this issue firmly on the
   agenda.

   As a lifelong Liverpool fan, I am angry and disappointed by the
   proposals to raise the prices to £77 a seat.

   How can [130]season tickets breaking the £1,000 barrier be justified?

   Clubs cannot be allowed cynically to abuse fans’ loyalty. I can
   understand why they are furious.

   Fans must not be priced out of the game they love by [132]Premier
   League clubs just as they reap the rewards of a bumper TV deal.

   The gulf between fans and the owners of many clubs is growing,
   particularly in clubs owned by individuals without a connection to the
   local community.

   Working people have already been hit hard in the pocket by almost six
   years of Tory Government.

   The real wages of ordinary people have fallen since David Cameron
   became Prime Minister, yet the wealth of Premier League clubs and
   players’ salaries have gone through the roof in recent years.

   Peter Powell Liverpool Fans leave their seats in protest on the 77th
   minute to the highlight the new ticket prices at Anfield
   Anger: Liverpool fans make their feelings about increased ticket prices
   clear

   The Premier League has more than trebled its domestic revenue from TV
   rights since 2008.

   So why haven’t any savings been passed on to the fans, and why are
   clubs now squeezing more and more from their own fans?

   Why is so little of this money making its way down to the grass roots?

   Talk of a £30 price cap for away tickets is a good start, but I want to
   see clubs really get behind the Football Supporters’ Federation’s
   ‘Twenty is Plenty’ campaign.

   It cannot be right that the most loyal fans sometimes have to fork out
   well over £50 just for an away ticket, and that is before you add on
   the cost of travelling.

   Labour has long campaigned to give fans and supporters’ trusts a place
   on club boards.

   But the Government only last month turned their backs on giving fans a
   seat in every boardroom.

   We need to see more leadership from the Government, more leadership
   from the Premier League and more leadership from the clubs themselves.

   The Premier League is the best league on earth. But it is about time
   clubs started treating fans with the respect they deserve.

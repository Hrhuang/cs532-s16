   Caters Spot the zebra inbetween the herd of Wildebeest
   Take a look: There’s a zebra in among these wildebeest

   Forget Where's Wally – can you spot the zebra in this [128]herd of
   wildebeest?

   These incredible photos show a huge herd of wildebeest stampeding
   through the African bush – but lurking among the pack is a zebra.

   Despite his distinctive marking, the zebra is almost impossible to pick
   out among the crowd of wildebeest.

   The incredible photos of the wildebeest migration were snapped by
   German wildlife photographer Ingo Gerlach in Maasai Mara, Kenya.

   Ingo said: "Every year we see this amazing display of nature – but this
   sight was more than I ever expected.

   Nature’s power: A photographer captured the wildebeest – and zebra - in
   stampede

   Caters Spot the zebra inbetween the herd of Wildebeest
   Peril: The wildebeest brave the dangerous river crossing

   "There are around 1.5 million wildebeest that wander through the
   savannah in the Tanzanian Serengeti and Maasai Mara.

   "There were that many animals the ground looked black, and the noise
   was indescribable.

   Caters Spot the zebra inbetween the herd of Wildebeest
   Surge: There were around 80,000 animals in the stampede

   "The masses made their way in the direction of the river – firstly
   cautious, but then the herds behind them pushed their way forward.

   "I think there were around 80,000 wildebeest at that point.

   "However, the animals hit a wall on the other side of the river where
   there was a huge, steep wall and many rocks.

   Now you see him: The zebra joins the river crossing

   "The animals kept slipping on the rocks – there was a stampede and lots
   of animals were crushed, drowned or became victims of hungry
   [129]crocodiles.

   "The whole thing took about two hours – my adrenaline went through the
   roof.

   "The herd was such a huge size, it really was an unusual sight."

   The Canadian Red Cross, having eliminated all pain and suffering in
   Canada, has set its sights on video games that use red crosses to
   denote in-game health-packs. They've sent lawyer-letters to game-makers
   telling them that marking health-packs with red crosses is illegal and
   will damage the Canadian Red Cross.

   Why is the Red Cross wasting the charitable dollars we donate to it
   shaking down video-games on the basis of some trademark dilution
   bogeyman? Is there any question that the use of red crosses to denote
   health-packs in games will bring even the most minute quantum of harm
   to the Red Cross? Kee-rist. I mean, I hear about a lot of stupid, crazy
   stuff, but this takes (today's) cake.

     [canadianredcrosslogo.jpg?resize=177%2C175] The fact that the Red
     Cross is also used in videos which contain strong language and
     violence is also of concern to us in that they directly conflict
     with the basic humanitarian principles espoused by the Red Cross
     movement,'' Pratt said in a Jan. 31 letter to a Vancouver law firm
     that represents several Canadian game developers. "The crux of the
     problem is that the misuse of the Red Cross in video games is not
     only in contravention of the law, it also encourages others to
     believe that the emblem of the Red Cross is `public property' and
     can be freely used by any organization or indeed for commercial
     purposes."
     I contacted the Canadian Red Cross for comment on this -- I wanted
     to know if there was any precedent for Canadian charities suffering
     harm arising from game-based trademark dilution, and if they could
     cite precedent or statute under which the games' use of the red
     cross was unlawful, but they didn't get back to me. If they contact
     me later, I'll update this post. [14]Link (Thanks, [15]Alice!)

     Update: [16]Allen sez, "The Red Cross has an even bigger, more
     menacing trademark infringer. A little outfit they call
     [17]Switzerland. Somebody should inform the Red Cross that these
     guys have been flagrantly using the unique design they created for
     their logo."

     Update 2: Varney sez, "The International Red Cross recently chose
     [18]a new, neutral symbol which can be used anywhere without
     offending any theology. One would imagine that the old Red Cross
     would be deprecated once this is introduced."

   Where are our petabyte drives? Brian Hayes takes us through the reasons

   much more right now, so the focus since then has been on SSDs,
   networking, interfaces, etc, […]

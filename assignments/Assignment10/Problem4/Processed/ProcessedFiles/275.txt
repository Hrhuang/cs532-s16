Amazon announces its own game engine with built-in Twitch support

   for big and small games alike.

   Online retailer Amazon continues its push into gaming today with the
   announcement of Amazon Lumberyard. It's a free, cross-platform, 3D game
   engine that the company says is capable of delivering the "highest
   quality games," featuring "beautiful worlds, realistic characters, and
   stunning real-time effects."

   Lumberyard wasn't the only new gaming tool that Amazon announced today.
   The company also revealed Amazon GameLift, a program for Lumberyard
   that aims to allow developers to increase the scale and performance of
   their online multiplayer games "without any additional engineering
   effort or upfront costs."

   The Lumberyard engine launches today in beta form for [114]PC and
   console developers. Support for unspecified mobile and virtual reality
   platforms will come later, the company said.

   As you might have assumed, Lumberyard features native Twitch support.
   [116]Amazon purchased Twitch in 2014 for $1 billion.

   The engine also includes a "full-featured editor" and "hundreds" of
   other elements including cloth physics, character and animation
   editors, audio tools, weather effects, and vehicle systems. Amazon also
   noted that Lumberyard developers get full access to the engine's source
   code.

   Lumberyard isn't completely free, however, as developers will need to
   pay the regular Amazon Web Services fee to use it. For GameLift, there
   is a "small per-player fee" as well that comes out to $1.50 for 1,000
   daily active users.

   You can check out the announcement video above to learn more about
   Lumberyard and the developers currently using it.

   "By starting game projects with Amazon Lumberyard, developers are able
   to spend more of their time creating differentiated gameplay and
   building communities of fans, and less time on the undifferentiated
   heavy lifting of building game engine components and managing server
   infrastructure," Amazon said. "And, with Amazon GameLift, developers
   can be sure that on day one, their live, multiplayer games can scale to
   support millions of players, while maintaining the high performance
   gamers expect."

   In other Amazon gaming news, the company[117] acquired Double Helix
   Games at the start of 2014. Last summer, [118]a number of key staffers
   departed from the Amazon Game Studios, the company's internal division
   dedicated to gaming.

When nature calls a goalie

   Unlike his fellow NHL players who tailor their game day meals with an
   eye on fuel and nutrition, Capitals goaltender Braden Holtby follows
   his gut whenever he is scheduled to start. “It’s all based around
   what’s not going to make my stomach upset,” the current Vezina Trophy
   frontrunner says. “It’s something you have to think about.”

   On the road, for instance, that means pasta and olive oil, plain with
   no meat sauce. Hotel kitchens have not yet earned Holtby's trust. Like
   every other goalie, he has good reason for dietary caution. As he and
   his peers will attest, the demands of their position create unique
   challenges when the old boiler starts rumbling and nature comes
   calling. First, netminders wear more equipment than any athlete in any
   major professional team sport. They are buried in pads, straps, hooks,
   knots, buckles and buttons, plus jerseys that are baggy enough to pitch
   as campsite tents. Goaltenders are also uniquely needed on the field of
   play for an entire game, a requirement to which only soccer players can
   relate. No sneaking away between shifts like skaters or ducking into
   the dugout bathroom between innings as baseball players do.

[246]NHL kangaroo courts fine for relieving players of their cash

   The very real possibility of an unfortunately timed gastric event
   is why Holtby abandoned his usual pregame java during his minor-league
   visits to AHL Wilkes-Barre while playing for Hershey, switching to Diet
   Coke because the locker room coffee did not sit well there.

   It is why meat sauce is bad.

   “I think we’ve all had that uh-oh moment,” Holtby says.

   Nine years ago, during the third period Western Conference semi-finals
   Game 5 against Anaheim, Vancouver netminder Roberto Luongo developed,
   as he describes it today, “a little bit of a bellyache.” He dismissed
   the feeling at first, hoping it would disappear in the heat of
   competition. After all, the Canucks were already down three games to
   one in the series and needed a road win to stay alive.

   Trailing 1–0, Luongo saved eight shots in the third period and
   Alex Burrows tied the game at the 11:03 mark. Before heading onto the
   ice for overtime, Luongo felt his bellyache worsen and realized he
   couldn’t fight it off much longer. Fortunately, a trainer assured him
   that the officials wouldn’t drop the puck until he returned from the
   can. “I was there doing my business and I hear the play starting in the
   arena,” Luongo says. “So I panicked there. I don’t remember if I wiped.
   I just put my gear back on, tried to get out there as soon as I could.”

   When Luongo reached the bench, he saw that backup Dany Sabourin was in
   Vancouver’s crease. During the next three minutes and 34 seconds,
   Sabourin stopped five would-be-game-winners, admirably relieving
   Luongo after Luongo had relieved himself.

   “That’s just the way it is with me,” Luongo says. “Bad stomach. Coffees
   don’t help, but I need those. Sometimes you’ve got to pay the price."

[256]Restless legs: Behind the scenes with the Capitals on a back-to-back
swing

   Luongo eventually replaced Sabourin and backstopped the Canucks into
   double OT, but he allowed Scott Niedermayer’s series-ending goal while
   signaling at the officials for what he thought was a penalty on the
   play. The elimination was bitter, no question, but it could have been
   worse in at least one respect.

   “I don't know what happened,” Luongo says. “Something just came over
   me. Sometimes it just goes away, right? And your mind gets off it. But
   this time it wasn’t going away. Thank god they didn’t score (while I
   was in the bathroom), because our season would’ve been over. That might
   be a better story, but I don’t think it would’ve been fun though.”

   (As a consolation prize, the most famous bathroom break in NHL history
   made Luongo—or “Loo,” as fans may chant—[264]uniquely qualified to
   analyze Lightning goalie Ben Bishop's mysterious disappearance during
   Game 2 of the 2015 Stanley Cup Final.)

   Lest you believe these matters aren’t discussed among the goaltending
   fraternity, consider this: When SI.com recently called about the
   business of avoiding business, longtime NHL netminder Olie Kolzig was
   in Hershey, Pa., visiting minor-leaguers as the Capitals’ professional
   development coach. After practice that afternoon, he took goalies Dan
   Ellis and Justin Peters out to lunch. Inspired by an assistant who had
   fled practice particularly fast, the topic came up.

   “They asked me if it ever happened to me,” Kolzig says. “I said I
   never, ever had to leave a game to go to the bathroom. And having said
   that, your next question will be, did you ever have to relieve
   yourself? No. There were times I was probably gritting my teeth,
   waiting for the final horn to go, but never had an incident like that.”

   Naturally, it pays to prepare for that possibility.Ty Conklin, a
   veteran of six NHL teams who retired in 2013, always took advantage of
   the first television timeout to dash to the urinal, getting the first
   flush out of the way early. “He was just so superstitious,” former
   teammate and fellow goaltender Jimmy Howard says. “I don’t know if half
   the time he had to go or what. He’d just take off down the hallway and
   take a leak.”

   Among the nine current and former NHL goaltenders who were interviewed
   for this piece of “journalism,” smoking-gun stories were uncommon. Few
   recalled specific times when the need to go interrupted their
   professional duties. Science supports their memory. During exercise,
   the kidneys receive less blood flow but absorb more fluids, reducing
   the production of urine. Minnesota's Devan Dubnyk, for instance,
   regularly goes between periods but always manages to wait. Consider
   this the renal form of holding out. “You go there and you forget about
   it,” Holtby says. “Just the way your body works.”

   In desperate times, though, the sheer volume of a goalie’s equipment
   poses an intimidating final hurdle. New, stiffer pants are difficult to
   scrunch beneath the bowl. Fiddling with the suspenders or getting stuck
   in the jersey wastes precious time. “You’ve got a bigger cup than the
   players do, so that’s a little awkward or bulky, unless you’re a really
   well endowed person, you’ve got to fight getting over your cup, your
   pants,” Kolzig says. For this reason, he adds, spillage happens.

   "It’s a little easier for the forwards, because pants just drop down to
   your ankles and you go," says Ottawa goalkeeper Craig Anderson. "For
   goalies, you’ve got the pads on, the chest protector, everything’s tied
   in together. You lace everything together so you can have a good seal
   so you don’t have any other holes. To go to the bathroom, you’ve got to
   really push down on the pants as far as you can."

   This all ties into the hot button rules issue of today: the discussion
   of goalie equipment size. In Nashville at the All-Star Game, Holtby,
   Dubnyk, Bishop and Cory Schneider all viewed prototypes of slimmed-down
   gear and offered feedback. The hope on both the NHL’s and the players’
   side is to rewrite the rule book standards and clarify regulations.
   Maybe, tangentially, they will eliminate some bulk in the bathroom too.
   Whatever emerges, though, will likely not include what retired
   goaltender Marty Turco’s teammates assumed he had all along: “A trap
   door like a lumberjack.”

   And since Don Cherry once called him [274]the NHL’s smartest
   goaltender, it’s only fitting that Turco would lend his expertise to
   the last word in this sophisticated discussion.

   “I really enjoy when even non-goalies put on goalie gear just to
   appreciate how hard it is to move, how tiring it is to go up and down
   with that crap on,” Turco says. “I think inevitably, one or two of them
   always says, ‘Uhhh, what happens if you’ve got to take a s---?” And
   you’re like, ‘Yeah, don’t s---.’ That’s why we’re smarter than the rest
   of you guys, because we think about this stuff all the time.”

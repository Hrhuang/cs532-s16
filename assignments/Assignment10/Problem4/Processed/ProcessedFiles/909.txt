LED Lighting Scores Big Savings in Sports Facilities

   February 1, 2016 - [283]Lighting

   Sports facilities across the country are turning to light emitting
   diode (LED) lighting to illuminate the fields and stands for games.
   A recent [284]Forbes article discusses the impact that LED lighting is
   making on the sports industry. The magazine reported that an estimated
   90 percent of facility operators in 2015 who installed lighting systems
   at sports facilities chose LEDs.
   One company estimated that facilities are saving 75-85 percent on
   energy costs with the switch.
   Among the more popular venues currently using LEDs or soon converting
   to them are three NFL franchises — University of Phoenix Stadium
   (Arizona Cardinals), Sun Life Stadium (Miami Dolphins) and the new U.S.
   Bank Stadium (Minnesota Vikings) in Minneapolis, which opens for play
   next season. Two other NFL stadiums are also planning the switch.
   The LED market for sports venues continues to develop, but slowly. The
   article described the penetration at less than 5 percent.
   The initial cost of LEDs might scare some facilities away, as the
   installation costs can range up to $2 million, but stadium operators
   hope to achieve payback on the systems in less than three years.
   This Quick Read was submitted by [285]Dave Lubach, Associate Editor of
   Facility Maintenance Decisions magazine. Read more on the impact of
   LEDs in the maintenance and engineering field [286]here.

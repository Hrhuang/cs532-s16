     Four boys varsity games and two junior varsity contests are
     scheduled for the St. Jude Shootout on Saturday at Mason City Illini
     Central.

     Admission, good for the entire day, is $5. Proceeds will go to St.
     Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital in Peoria.

     The schedule begins with two junior varsity games: Delavan vs.
     Havana at noon, and Illini Central vs. St. Anne at 1:30 p.m.

     The varsity games begin with Hartsburg-Emden vs. St. Anne at 3 p.m.
     Then it’s Delavan vs. Havana at 4:30. Peoria Quest meets Chicago
     Hope at 6, and Illini Central meets Winnetka North Shore Country Day
     at 7:30.

     The final game is a rematch of the 2011 Class 1A state third-place
     game won by Illini Central over North Shore 51-48.

     Fundraiser helps T-C’s Gordon

     It’s been a difficult winter for Buffalo Tri-City’s Andrew “Dewie”
     Gordon. But the Tornadoes’ junior starter received a boost on Friday
     when Tri-City hosted South County.

     A fundraiser, including a pregame mostaccioli dinner, raised
     approximately $5,000 that will go toward Gordon’s college fund.

     Gordon’s father, Robert Gordon, died in late December. It was less
     than two years after he lost his mother, Debra Weinant, to cancer.

     Tri-City lost the varsity game to South County 43-35, but Dewie
     Gordon scored a career-high 19 points.

     Gillespie coach praises Stauder

     Gillespie earned its second double-overtime win in less than two
     weeks Friday night when the Miners outlasted Pana 90-86.

     But Gillespie coach Casey Sholtis, whose team also edged Piasa
     Southwestern 76-70 in double-overtime Jan. 26, said Friday’s game
     would’ve ended in regulation if not for Pana’s Blake Stauder.

     Sholtis said Gillespie led Pana 68-65 with just a few seconds left
     in regulation and Stauder had the ball beyond the top of the key.

     “I thought we had (Stauder) defended pretty well; we had a hand in
     his face,” Sholtis said. “But he got off a shot and it went in
     before the buzzer.

     “It was a heck of a shot. He was just to the left of the top of the
     key. He was almost horizontal when he put it up.”

     Gillespie called timeout with 1.6 seconds left but the Miners missed
     a three-quarter-court shot as the game went to the first of the two
     overtimes.

     WRESTLING

     Gamble pays off for Hampson

     Lanphier senior Chase Hampson has had a very good season wrestling
     at 170 pounds. He probably had potential to make an extended
     postseason run at that weight class.

     Page 2 of 3 - But for Saturday’s Class 2A Springfield High School
     Regional, Hampson moved to the 182-pound class and won a regional
     championship.

     It’s the third time Hampson (17-7) has advanced to sectionals after
     a fourth-place finish as a freshman.

     He knew the move up a class wouldn’t be easy.

     “I think I’m pretty good sized for 170, but I knew at 182 I’d be
     outmatched in size so I’d have to match up speed and technique,”
     Hampson said after beating Chatham Glenwood’s Aiden Woodfall 4-3. “I
     knew it would be difficult.”

     Those difficulties were exacerbated by an upper-body injury that
     flared up in that championship match.

     “I’ve been battling (that) injury for a while now for half the
     season,” Hampson said. “I knew it was going to come up eventually
     today but I didn’t know it would come in such a drastic moment in
     the match.”

     Crumb wishes foe well

     In the heavyweight division championship bout of Saturday’s 2A
     Springfield High Regional, Lanphier senior Edthao Crumb evened his
     record against Chatham Glenwood freshman Will Putnam with a 6-2 win.
     Putnam (23-7) beat Crumb 4-1 on Jan. 21.

     After Saturday’s match, an elated regional champion Crumb (23-1) was
     hopeful to continue to wrestle Putnam at least two more times this
     season.

     “We’re on two different sides of the bracket so hopefully we have
     each other in the finals at sectionals and then we both get to go to
     state and hopefully wrestle each other in the finals at state,”
     Crumb said. “That’s my hope for him and me right now.”

     Shearer on Cloud Nine

     Springfield High senior two-sport athlete Jackson Shearer gets to
     extend the “athlete” part of being a student-athlete for a few more
     weeks.

     While Shearer is still working through the effects of a
     long-lingering cold that has sapped his energy, he was able to
     secure a spot in this weekend’s Class 2A Mahomet-Seymour Sectional
     with a third-place finish at 170 pounds.

     When the Senators also won the regional team title, it meant he’ll
     be part of Springfield High’s attempt to win the Mattoon Dual Team
     Sectional on Feb. 23.

     “I was thinking about not wrestling this year and I’m very glad I
     stuck with it,” Shearer said. “I love all of my teammates; we’ve
     worked a lot. We have a hell of a coaching staff; they push us
     really hard and we push each other in the room.

     Page 3 of 3 - “I’m really happy I made sectionals for the first time
     in all three years wrestling varsity.”

     Shearer (29-15) beat Heath Fleming 2-1 for third place.

   If you’re excited to try indie development studios Campo Santo and
   Panic’s gripping mystery game [59]Firewatch, you’ll be happy to learn
   that there’s a cool easter egg to look forward to in the PC version.

   There’s a disposable camera somewhere in the forest that lets you snap
   photos in the game world. Once you finish the game, you’ll be able to
   order actual 4×6 prints of your shots to be mailed to you anywhere in
   the world.

So. Much. Tech.

   Some of the biggest names in tech are coming to TNW Conference in
   Amsterdam this May.
   [60]Learn more

   [61]TechnoBuffalo reported that prior to this week’s official launch, a
   set of prints cost $15. and shipped in two to four weeks. The price may
   have gone up since, but if you enjoyed the game, this is as cool a
   memento as you could ever ask for.

   Sadly, the feature isn’t yet available for PlayStation 4 as it requires
   network access and is a bit more complicated to implement for consoles.
   Panic’s [62]Cabel Sasser told Polygon, “We are actively investigating
   what it would take to make this happen on the PlayStation 4. Sony wants
   it and so do we!”

   snap physically developed [TechnoBuffalo]

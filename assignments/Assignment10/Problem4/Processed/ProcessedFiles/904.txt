   While the [121]Cleveland Browns disputed a report Tuesday that they had
   "lied" about [122]Johnny Manziel's concussion symptoms prior to the
   season finale to cover for the quarterback reportedly showing up drunk
   to a team meeting that week, one well-placed Browns source who had
   contact with Manziel that day told ESPN's Adam Schefter that he "was
   heavily hung over on something."

   An independent neurologist diagnosed Manziel with a concussion four
   days before the 2015 season finale, the Browns said Tuesday. Manziel
   was not cleared from concussion protocol by the independent doctor
   until Jan. 12, according to a team statement.

   The statement from the Browns came in response to an NFL Network report
   that the Browns "lied" about the concussion to protect Manziel because
   he was drinking heavily and had showed up for a team meeting
   inebriated.

   "Johnny Manziel came to our facility on the morning of December 30th
   and complained of concussion symptoms," a statement released by the
   team said. "He was tested by an independent neurologist and entered the
   league's concussion protocol. He remained in the protocol until January
   12th after being cleared by the independent neurologist."
   [r19396_2_600x400_3-2.jpg&w=130&h=130&scale=crop&location=center] A
   source told ESPN that Johnny Manziel showed up on the day of a team
   meeting prior to the season finale "not drunk ... but he was
   [recovering] from being on something. I don't know what he was doing
   the night before, but something was wrong with him." George
   Gojkovich/Getty Images

   Manziel missed the finale because of the concussion, but was reported
   to be in Las Vegas that weekend -- much to the Browns' surprise. He
   missed a scheduled assessment Jan. 3.

   The Browns' new director of football operations, Sashi Brown, said
   Manziel returned for other scheduled assessments after the season,
   before he was cleared.

   One well-placed Browns source who had contact with Manziel on Dec. 30
   told Schefter: "Manziel looked terrible. He wasn't drunk, but he was
   heavily hung over on something. There was something going on there."

   Manziel complained that he was having trouble with light, was vomiting
   and had a headache.

   "This wasn't some massive cover-up," the source told Schefter. "What
   are you going to do? You have to put him in the protocol.

   "... He was not drunk that day, but he was [recovering] from being on
   something. I don't know what he was doing the night before, but
   something was wrong with him."

   One Browns player told ESPN that several teammates knew Manziel had
   complained of headaches early that week, and that Manziel had briefly
   attended a quarterbacks meeting early that morning.

   Another source had said Manziel arrived late for a meeting that
   Wednesday looking disheveled and that the team got him out of the
   meeting before putting him on the concussion protocol.

   Manziel was hit in the head twice in a 17-13 loss to the [126]Kansas
   City Chiefs on Dec. 27. Linebacker [127]Josh Mauga hit him
   helmet-to-helmet at the end of a scramble, and Manziel's head hit the
   turf after he was tackled by [128]Allen Bailey on another
   fourth-quarter run.

   At the time, the Browns said they were not sure what hit caused the
   concussion.

   A medical source familiar with the league's concussion protocols told
   ESPN that if any player complains of symptoms, the medical staff is
   obligated to take the player at his word. In the present climate, a
   player who reports symptoms will almost certainly be placed in the
   protocol.

   Complaints like headaches, nausea and dizziness are often the first
   indicators of a concussion and are reported to the team by the player,
   the source said.

   "People should be very cautious about suggesting medical personnel
   would deliberately falsify a diagnosis," the source said, "particularly
   when a player's subjective report of symptoms is involved in making
   that diagnosis.

   "Imagine if a player complained of symptoms and the medical staff
   didn't place him in the protocol? Imagine how lambasted they would be.
   Medical care of any kind is predicated on a patient being truthful."

   ESPN Staff Writer Jeremy Fowler contributed to this report.

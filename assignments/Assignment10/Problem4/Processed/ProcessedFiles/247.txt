   REDLANDS, Calif. (Feb. 8, 2016) â€“ The backcourt trio of freshman
   [74]Brent Cahill (Laguna Beach, Calif. / Laguna Beach), junior
   [75]Ricky Galliani (Menlo Park, Calif. / Sacred Heart Prep) and
   sophomore [76]David Kawashima (Studio City, Calif. / North Hollywood)
   was absolutely terrific as yet another second-half comeback by Caltech
   men's basketball short by the slimmest of margins in a 75-71 defeat at
   the University of Redlands on Monday night.

   With the loss, Caltech drops to 8-13 overall and 6-6 in the SCIAC,
   which puts the Beavers just outside of the playoff picture in fifth
   place for the first time this season.  Redlands holds a half-game lead
   on the Beavers for fourth at 6-5 and evens its record at 10-10 overall.

   Caltech was undone by a 22-7 disadvantage in second-chance points
   thanks to Redlands grabbing 18 offensive rebounds while narrowly
   outshooting the visitors, 43-42 percent from the field and 50-44
   percent beyond the arc.

   The Beavers fell into an early 14-4 hole which could have been much
   worse if not for junior [77]Lawrence Lee (Hong Kong / Hong Kong
   International School) single-handedly keeping the visitors in it as he
   knocked down a three-pointer, then was fouled on another and sank all
   three free throws to cancel out another pair of consecutive threes from
   the hot-shooting Bulldogs.  Redlands still managed to surge ahead by 12
   at 22-10 just before the midpoint in the first half, but the Caltech
   offense exploded for 12 points on the next five straight possessions
   thanks in part to three consecutive assists by Kawashima while allowing
   just two points to pull back within a basket with 8:06 remaining.

   Redlands responded with seven unanswered points to stretch back out to
   a nine-point lead with 5:49 on the clock.  Cahill hit two free throws
   to help keep the deficit in single digits, then ended a
   three-and-a-half-minute scoreless drought with a layup to bring Caltech
   within five.  The Bulldogs had another quick answer, however, as center
   Blake O'Brien hit a layup in the post and dropped in a three-pointer to
   extend the margin back to double digits with 3:52 left in the half.

   Caltech would hold Redlands to just one more basket before the break
   while sinking five free throws and getting a layup from Cahill, who
   racked up the Beavers' final six points of the half in a two-minute
   span to take his team into halftime down five at 38-33.

   As has been typical for the Beavers this season, Caltech came out of
   the intermission on another level, immediately pulling back within a
   basket on a Lee layup and making it a two-point game as Galliani hit
   one of two free throws after a technical foul assessed to the Redlands
   bench.  The junior proceeded to drill back-to-back three-pointers to
   tie the game at 42-42 just three minutes into the second half and
   suddenly it was a new ballgame.

   Although the Beavers went another six minutes with just a single basket
   as Redlands built up another seven-point lead, Caltech would score
   another 10 points on consecutive possessions over the next two minutes
   to storm back within three at 57-54 with 8:52 left to play.  That
   margin more or less held for the next three minutes as the Bulldogs
   could not separate again by more than five until three straight baskets
   were followed by a dagger second-chance three-pointer that made it
   71-62 with just 3:53 remaining.

   The Beavers refused to give in, however, as Galliani and junior
   [78]Nasser Al-Rayes (Doha, Qatar / American School of Doha) followed
   with back-to-back trifectas to pull within a basket yet again and
   Kawashima earned a trip to the line on the next possession, where he
   hit the second to make it a two-point game with 1:15 left on the
   clock.  Cahill drove and lofted a scoop shot in to cancel out a
   Redlands jumper and Caltech called a timeout with 43 seconds
   remaining.

   Needing a defensive stop to have a chance for the game-tying basket,
   Caltech got more than that as Cahill stripped the ball at midcourt and
   the fast break was on.  The rookie sensation drove to his right, lofted
   his shot with both the defender's arms reaching over his head and the
   shot rolled just an inch short as no whistle blew and Redlands pulled
   down the rebound.  With no choice but to foul, the Beavers sent Kyle
   Husslein, who had hit what proved to be the game-winner, to the line,
   where he sank both to seal the win.

   Cahill led the Beavers with a career-high 19 points, including going
   8-for-11 at the free throw line, and made a team-high three steals.
   Galliani continued his recent hot shooting with 16 points as he went a
   career-best 5-for-9 from long range and did not commit a single
   turnover; he is now 8-for-16 from beyond the arc in his last two
   games.  Kawashima paced the squad with nine rebounds and five assists
   against just two turnovers while also grabbing two steals and blocking
   a shot.  Al-Rayes and Lee chipped in 14 and 10 points, respectively, as
   each grabbed five rebounds and dished out two assists against just one
   turnover, with Al-Rayes also recording four blocks to set a new
   single-season program record (55).

   Head Coach Dr. Oliver Eslinger and the Beavers will enjoy a five-day
   break from competition and get a fresh look at the playoff picture as
   the rest of the conference plays this Wednesday.  Caltech heads to
   third-place Whittier College (12-8, 7-4) on Saturday, Feb. 13 for a 2
   p.m. tipoff.

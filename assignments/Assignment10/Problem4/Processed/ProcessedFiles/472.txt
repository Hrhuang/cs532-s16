Gamecocks the latest to try to stop LSU’s Big Ben from ticking

   Simmons the likely next No. 1 NBA Draft pick

   South Carolina’s defense says it will have something for him

   First place in the SEC on the line
   LSU forward Ben Simmons (25) is the SEC’s top rebounder, third-best
   scorer and an athlete that is drawing comparisons to Magic Johnson.

   Sindarius Thornwell remembers the first time he saw him. He and his
   teammates at Oak Hill were playing Montverde Academy, and Montverde
   trotted out some gangly sophomore at forward.

   “No one knew who he was,” Thornwell said. “He started blocking and
   dunking … he was young, so he was doing what freshmen do. Effort plays
   – dunking, rebounding, blocking.

   “We were like, ‘Who is this kid?’ If they didn’t have him, we’d have
   won.”

   Three years later, a lot of Ben Simmons’ opponents are saying that. But
   he’s in an LSU uniform, biding his time until he will most likely be
   the No. 1 pick in the next NBA Draft, and that means South Carolina
   will be the latest team to try to shut down him and the red-hot Tigers.

   LSU has won six of its past seven SEC games and is alone in first
   place, while the Gamecocks are in a three-way tie for second, one game
   behind. The Gamecocks (20-3, 7-3 SEC) know what an advantage they have
   – they’re coming off their biggest win in years, a road victory over
   then-No. 8 Texas A&M, and they get the Tigers (15-8, 8-2) at home,
   where they’ve yet to lose this year.

   While Frank Martin and his players have not been ones to look ahead at
   what could be, Martin made it clear that everyone knows what
   Wednesday’s game means – first place.

   It’s there to be had, but Simmons, the SEC’s top rebounder, third-best
   scorer and an athlete that is drawing comparisons to Magic Johnson,
   will have something to say about it. Like Johnson, Simmons is a tall
   guy who can play point guard – and the problems he causes defenses has
   USC in the same situation as his other opponents.

   “Kevin Durant was an unbelievable matchup problem because of his size
   and his ability to shoot. Blake Griffin was a difficult matchup because
   he was an athletic bull,” Martin said, ticking off similar players to
   Simmons. “(Michael Beasley) was incredible. His ability to score
   inside-outside, using either hand, grab 15 rebounds a game, was just
   incredible.

   “Simmons has a little bit of all those guys. And he’s the best passer
   of all those guys I just described.”

   He’ll play up top, which brings USC’s defenders out of the lane to try
   to keep him from driving. If he gets past the first man, the Gamecocks’
   helpers will have to make a decision – step in front to take a charge,
   but risk leaving their man open for one of Simmons’ passes.

   USC’s had a lot of trouble guarding kick-out passes to 3-point shooters
   (94 allowed 3-pointers in 10 league games) but the Tigers are a
   middling 3-point team (33.7 percent, tied for seventh in the SEC).
   Still, it’s not just 3-point shooters Simmons can pass to – the Tigers
   are loaded with Keith Hornsby, Tim Quarterman, Craig Victor and Antonio
   Blakeney. They struggled in the non-conference season, but that was
   while Hornsby was hurt and Victor, an Arizona transfer, was ineligible.

   Led by Simmons, LSU is clicking. The Gamecocks’ defense, designed to
   force the Tigers into something they don’t want to do, is again on
   call.

   “I think it’s going to bother him a little bit,” forward Michael
   Carrera said. “We might have something for him.”

   The Gamecocks, like LSU, are trying to lock down an NCAA tournament
   berth.

   Being able to say they beat a top NBA draft pick would look awfully
   nice.

   The next LeBron James?

   Some compare Ben Simmons to LeBron James, others mention Magic Johnson,
   Kevin Durant or Blake Griffin. A closer look at the phenom:

   Hometown: Melbourne, Australia

   High school: Montverde Academy (Fla.)

   Age: 19

   Ht./Wt.: 6-10, 240

   College: LSU

   Class: Freshman

Scouting report

   Strengths: An extremely unique talent, combining size and strength,
   with point guard vision and passing skills ... Has the size and skill
   to defend and play all five positions in the NBA ... Attitude/character
   one of his greatest assets ... Huge hands.

   Weaknesses: Despite being a good scorer, he lacks a reliable jumpshot
   ... He is an above average leaper with strength, but is a notch (or
   two) below LeBron as a physical specimen, not necessarily a weakness.

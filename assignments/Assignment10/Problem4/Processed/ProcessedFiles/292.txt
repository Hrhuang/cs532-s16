Why Marketing for the Year In Which We Actually Live Is a Game Changer

   Your message must meet consumers on mobile with video By [28]Gary
   Vaynerchuk

   Video is the medium that has consumers’ attention right now.

   There's a discussion I want to have with the entire marketing world.
   Agencies, clients, everyone.

   This discussion is too important to leave anyone out of it. What I want
   to talk about is this: following consumer attention and where it is
   right now. It might seem like a no-brainer. You might be thinking that
   consumer attention is all any marketer thinks about, day in and day
   out.

   Unfortunately, it doesn't appear to be that way to me. Why? Because
   nobody seems to be actually paying attention to where the consumers are
   going. It's time to market in the year we actually live in.

   It baffles me that so much money is still spent on forms of advertising
   that are not beneficial to the consumer, nor where the current consumer
   attention is. Preroll ad views. Commercial breaks on streaming sites.
   These are the "impressions" marketers are focusing on. Why? Great
   marketing should feel like a renovation, not a rehash of what's been
   done before. For a consumer to get excited about something, to be
   compelled by something, it comes down to attention. Attention, not
   impressions. They need to really consume it. That is the game.

   There are two places that companies need to focus on now to win the
   marketing game: mobile—and the social networks contained within it. The
   second is video.

   Anyone who doesn't realize that the cellphone is exactly the same thing
   that the television was in 1965 is completely ignoring the future. When
   an ad comes on, when preroll shows up, people reach for their phones.
   As soon as the experience they were trying to have is interrupted by an
   invasive ad, the phone is where they turn to continue being
   entertained.

   Plus, the phone is always there. As you read this, is your phone within
   five feet of you? I thought so.

   Within the world of mobile, there are so many opportunities and ways to
   make content that can get a consumer's attention. But video is the
   medium with the most consumer attention at the moment. Now, that's not
   necessarily anything new. Video has always been the deepest way to
   engage an audience. The wide and fast success of television and movies
   shows us that. The Internet hasn't changed that at all, but it's
   certainly made it more apparent. And not only has it amplified the
   importance of video as a way to connect, but it's also put the tools to
   make it into the hands of so many more people.

   Creating engaging content has never been easier, and the social
   networks that are winning big right now are winning because they have
   placed such an emphasis on video. Platforms such as Facebook and
   Instagram have remained strong. As they grew, they placed more and more
   emphasis on video content.

   The next big social network? Snapchat.

   One major reason [30]Snapchat is winning, and will continue to win, is
   [31]its focus on video. The storytelling capabilities around how people
   create content on Snapchat is fantastic. There is so much room for
   creativity, and it reminds me far more of a space like YouTube than
   Twitter.

   It's also an especially interesting platform because the consumer
   attention it has is very deep. Snapchat hasn't quite matured or "sold
   out" yet, but it's boasting an enormous amount of daily active users.

   As of last December, 36 percent of Americans aged 18-29 had an account,
   and they are now reporting 7 billion video views each day, rivaling
   Facebook. But while the platform is big and has lots of opportunity,
   it's still quite young. We are just now starting to see the first signs
   of Snapchat aging up. It's about to go through its first 20- to 40-year
   renaissance, and that is exciting. It's a huge platform, but it still
   has a solid 24 to 36 months ahead of it that will be of great
   importance.

   The point is this: See where consumer attention is going and follow it.
   As I notice Snapchat taking off, I'm putting more and more emphasis,
   time and resources into it. So many marketers act like they're talking
   about attention, but they're not. Impressions do not equate to
   attention. Understand the emerging markets, understand where your
   consumer is, and meet them there.

   Don't make them come to you—chances are they won't.

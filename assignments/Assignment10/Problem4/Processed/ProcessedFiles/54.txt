   Cam Newton didn't say much to the media following the Panthers loss in

   A defiant Cam Newton addressed reporters for the first time since the
   Carolina Panthers’ MVP quarterback walked out of news conference
   minutes after his team fell to the Denver Broncos at Super Bowl 50 on
   Sunday.

   “I’ve been on the record saying that I’m a sore loser,"  Newton told
   reporters at the team’s practice facility in Charlotte on Tuesday. "Who
   likes to lose? You show me a good loser and I’m going to show you a
   loser. It’s not a popularity contest. I am here to win football games."

   Added Newton: “I have said it since Day 1. I am who I am. I know what
   I’m capable of and I know where I am going. If you want me to conform,
   I’m not that guy. If you want me to be that type of person, I’m not
   that. I am happy to say that. This league is a great league with or
   without me. I understand that. I am my own person. I take pride in
   that.”

   Newton was heavily criticized after he gave a handful of short answers
   to reporters and unexpectedly got up and exited the dais two minutes
   into the session. Newton was sacked seven times --- twice fumbling the
   ball, one of which was returned for a touchdown by the Broncos - and
   completed 18 of 41 passes for 265 yards. The Broncos won, 24-10.

   "It happened," Newton said. "I didn’t want to talk to the media at the
   time. The truth of the matter is that I still don’t want to talk to the
   media."

   Newton, who was selected as the league MVP on Saturday, gave some hope
   to Panthers fans.

   “We will be back,” Newton said. “I mean that. We will be back.”

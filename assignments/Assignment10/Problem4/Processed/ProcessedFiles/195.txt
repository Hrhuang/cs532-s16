   PALM HARBOR — Four Hurricanes scored in double figures Thursday and
   Palm Harbor University raced past visiting Tampa Bay Tech for a 74-52
   Class 7A region quarterfinal victory.
   Julia Ingram’s game-high 21 points led the way as PHU produced its
   second-highest scoring output of the season. The ‘Canes beat St.
   Petersburg 83-52 in the District 7A-10 semifinals last week.
   It was defense, though, that ignited PHU’s scoring, coach Darian Dublin
   said. “As long as we play defense, that’ll transition into offense,” he
   said. “For the last three practices we’ve been working strictly on
   defense. I know we can score but I want us to pick up the defense and
   stay with that.”
   That Hurricanes defense played a large role in producing 32 TBT
   turnovers and the quick transition buckets that followed. It also
   helped keep things close early.
   The Titans were spotted a 2-0 lead after the game started with Auryel
   Perkins hitting two free throws awarded when PHU was hit with a
   pre-tipoff technical foul for adding player names in their scorebook
   after it had been signed by officials.
   That small bit of momentum combined with a strong effort on the boards
   allowed TBT to lead throughout most of the first quarter before PHU’s
   Kiana Chew tied the game at 10-10 heading into the second. But after
   hitting the first shot of the next period, PHU used an 11-0 run to take
   command for good.
   The ‘Canes took a 29-20 lead into halftime and TBT managed to reduce
   its deficit to 62-52 with about 3 minutes remaining, but PHU closed out
   its fourth postseason win in program history on a 12-0 run.
   “I think with us we have our games where we start off slow, but we
   always pick it up once we remember what we can do,” Chew said after her
   17-point, 10-rebound, three-block performance. TBT has few answers for
   the 6-foot-3 junior in the second half. Chew mixed smooth post moves
   and an on-point mid-range jumper to score 13 of her 15 over the final
   two quarters.
   “It felt natural,” she said. “I’ve been working on these moves forever
   so now I need to actually start going through with what I’m doing.”
   Ingram and Chew were joined in double figures by Kayli Houmard (15
   points) and Cheyenne Livernois (13 points).
   “Usually I don’t score that much, last game I had 11 assists, but it’s
   nice to shoot the ball,” Livernois said. “Lately I’ve been feeling more
   confident and my team helps a lot.”
   TBT (14-14) was led by 14 points from Shannon Lise and 11 from Auryel
   Perkins.
   PHU improved to 3-3 all-time against Hillsborough County postseason
   opponents and will play another Tuesday at Dover Strawberry Crest. The
   unbeaten Chargers used a late push to beat Seminole, 74-57.
   The Hurricanes lost to Strawberry Crest 58-50 on Dec. 12 at the Indian
   Rocks Christian Winter Slam Tournament. PHU is the only team this year
   to keep a game against Strawberry Crest under double-digits.
   “We beat ourselves in that game so the next time we play them we really
   think we can pull out a big win,” Livernois said.
   “I’m excited because we’ve really had our chance to beat them and we
   know we can,” Chew said.
   Tuesday’s Class 7A region semifinal at Strawberry Crest will tip off at
   7 p.m.
   BOX SCORE:
   TBT – 10 – 10– 14 – 18 --- 52

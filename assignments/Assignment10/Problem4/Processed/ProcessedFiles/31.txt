   Tahlequah native Blake Stephens harvests a 6-by-6, 476-pound bull elk
   on the first day of the coveted Oklahoma Department of Wildlife
   Conservation elk hunt in the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge located
   near Lawton, Okla., on Dec. 8.

   The most coveted hunt to obtain through the Oklahoma Department of
   Wildlife Conservation’s controlled hunts program is undoubtedly the
   once-in-a-lifetime elk hunt in the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge.

   The chance of being drawn for this hunt is minute. This year, over
   35,000 hunters applied for the 180 available elk tags, leaving each
   applicant with a 0.005 percent chance of acquiring a tag.

   Tahlequah native Blake Stephens, age 54, was one of the hunters whose
   name was drawn.

   Blake, a lifelong outdoorsman who has experience harvesting a wide
   range of different game, had entered his name in the lottery-type elk
   hunt drawing for 29 years before finally being selected. And much to
   his surprise, his son, 29-year-old Joshua Stephens, was also drawn for
   this year’s prestigious elk hunt after applying for the past 11 years.

   “We were elated about being drawn out,” Blake said. “My son, Joshua,
   called me and said he had been selected for the elk hunt, and I thought
   he was pulling my leg. It just sounded too good to be true for one of
   us to be that fortunate.”

   Turns out, Joshua and Blake were the fortunate ones. After his phone
   conversation with his son, Blake checked the ODWC website and found
   that he, too, had been drawn for the hunt.

   “I immediately called Joshua back and told him the good news,” Blake
   said. “We were really fired up and excited. The odds of one person
   drawing out for a hunt in their lifetime is small enough, but for a man
   and his son to draw out in the same year, that’s basically like winning
   the lottery.”

   As advertised, the Wichita Mountains elk hunt is truly a
   once-in-a-lifetime event. Once a hunter draws out, he or she will never
   be eligible for the hunt again. That is true whether the hunter
   harvests an elk, does not harvest an elk or is unable to make the trip.

   “You know that you’ll never get to do it again,” Blake said. “About
   seven or 10 years ago was when they made it a lifetime hunt. So, up
   until then, if you drew out, you could put your name into the drawing
   again. But that’s not the case anymore.”

   Hunters who are lucky enough to be drawn also get to see parts of the
   Wichita Mountains refuge not open to the public. Unlike most whitetail
   deer hunting where you sit in a stand and wait, in the estimated
   5,000-acre designated hunting area in the Wichitas, you have to spot
   and stalk the elk.

   This year’s bunch of selected hunters were divided into two separate
   groups for a 2.5-day hunt in December and a 2.5-day hunt in January.
   Blake was slotted for the December hunt, while Joshua was scheduled for
   January.

   Each hunter was allowed to being a helper to help skin, quarter and
   pack the harvested elk. Joshua and Blake chose each other to be their
   appointed helpers, giving them an opportunity to experience the
   prestigious event twice over the course of a little more than one
   month.

   Blake noted that while the Wichita Mountains features a beautiful and
   scenic landscape, the rough terrain can be physically taxing.

   “You’re walking around on mountainous, rough terrain stalking elk all
   day and it gets tiring, so it makes sense to have a helper with you to
   help harvest your elk,” Blake said. “It was pretty neat to have Joshua
   with me for my hunt and for me to help him out on his.”

   Both Blake and Joshua harvested their elk on the first day of their
   respective hunts, and coincidentally, both of them acquired their bulls
   at the same time of 4:10 p.m. Blake’s bull (harvested on December 8)
   measured out at 6-by-6 and field dressed at 476 pounds, while Joshua
   also acquired a 6-by-6 bull (harvested on January 12).

   “The 29-year anticipation of what my hunt would someday be is now a
   memory,” Blake said. “I felt blessed to be able to share my experience
   with my son. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Oklahoma
   Department of Wildlife Conservation partner in making this one of the
   best hunts in the country. The staff goes above and beyond to make sure
   the hunters enjoy their lifetime hunt.”

   The elk herd in the Wichita Mountains refuge is estimated to be around
   1,000 before the hunts. Rod Smith, the Southwest Region Supervisor for
   the refuge, reported that 63 bulls and cows were harvested in the
   December hunt this year, leaving a 90 percent success rate for bull
   hunters and a 75 percent success rate for cow hunters. In the January
   hunt, there were 62 bulls and cows harvested. The overall success rate
   was 81 percent for both hunts.

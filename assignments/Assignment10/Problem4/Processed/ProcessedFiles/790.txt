Deloitte: Get physicians in the healthcare analytics game

   independently to a methodology in which physicians are evaluated in
   clusters, will share insights at HIMSS16.

   Deloitte proposes moving away from evaluating physicians independently
   to a methodology in which physicians are evaluated in clusters.

   Physicians need to have and share analytical information to deliver
   quality care that drives down costs. But too often valuable findings
   aren’t making it to the right people, according to Deloitte’s Dorrie
   Guest.

   “My mantra has always been, we can use advanced analytics and do
   predictive modeling, but you have to pair analytics with action,” she
   said. “That’s the crux of the matter.”

   Guest is a director at Deloitte Consulting and national lead for
   physician enterprise and ambulatory services. She and John Keith, a
   practice leader of Deloitte Consulting’s healthcare services, will
   share their work in a presentation at HIIMSS16.

   Deloitte proposes moving away from evaluating physicians independently
   to a methodology in which physicians are evaluated in clusters.
   Healthcare is practiced in teams, with population-level quality
   outcomes driven by a cohesive group effort to keep patients healthy.

   Putting this into practice requires more than e-mailed mandates.

   The first step for a clinically integrated system is to look at what
   motivates physicians, she said.

   “Physician behavior is highly influenced by other physicians they
   respect,” Guest said.

   [Also: [27]Analytics market struggles with value-based care]

   Also important to the physician is the credibility of data focusing on
   patient outcomes, she said. And simple networking allows physicians to
   know who is in their health network, which is currently a challenge.

   “What are the quality and outcomes of fellow physicians that are part
   of that network? They have to meet each other,” Guest said.

   Unless providers are looking at care patterns, especially with complex
   cases, they won’t be able to see quality and outcomes of cost. But what
   Deloitte found was that costs go up when no one is managing the
   transition and care coordination of both an individual patient and the
   population as a whole. And that requires tracking care from the primary
   care doctor to cardiologist or other specialist to surgeon, Guest said,
   because doctors may not be communicating with each other.

   “Take a deep dive into the same health system,” she said. “Are they
   sharing information back and forth? In the area of population health,
   when they agree to share clinical information and follow consistent
   protocols and collectively manage the health, then you have better
   outcomes.”

   “Scoring for Value, Individual vs. Population Methods” will take place
   1 to 1:30 p.m., Thursday, March 3, in the Population Health Knowledge
   Center, Booths 14090 – 14117, Casanova.

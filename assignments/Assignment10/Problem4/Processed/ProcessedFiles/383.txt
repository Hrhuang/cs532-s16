   and hundreds of other features, Amazon Lumberyard gives professional
   developers the tools and technology they need to build world-class
   games.

Build Live, Online Features in Minutes

   With Amazon Lumberyard’s visual scripting tool, your designers and
   engineers with little to no backend experience can add cloud-connected
   features to a game in as little as minutes (such as a community news
   feed, daily gifts, or server-side combat resolution) through
   drag-and-drop visual scripting.

   Amazon Lumberyard is integrated with Twitch so that you can build games
   that engage with the more than 1.7 million monthly broadcasters, and
   more than 100 million monthly viewers on Twitch. With Amazon
   Lumberyard's Twitch ChatPlay, you can use a drag-and-drop visual
   scripting interface to create gameplay features in as little as minutes
   that let Twitch viewers use chat to directly impact the game they are
   watching in real-time. And, the Twitch JoinIn feature within Amazon
   Lumberyard helps you build games that let Twitch broadcasters to
   instantly invite their live audiences to join them side-by-side in the
   game, with a single click, while others continue to watch.

   Guys, sorry about the small videos that are shaky and weird. I had a
   bunch of camera issues that I hope to fix by the next cover!
   **Some comments on this video may have spoilers! Careful about reading
   them if you're not caught up with all the books so far.**
   Don't know about you, but that second to last episode of Game of
   Thrones was my favorite of the season. And as soon as I heard this song
   by The National, I knew I wanted to make a cover of it. :)
   Download the song on Loudr & iTunes:

   The lyrics:
   Rains of Castamere
   And who are you, the proud lord said, that I must bow so low?
   Only a cat of a different coat, that's all the truth I know.
   In a coat of gold or a coat of red, a lion still has claws,
   And mine are long and sharp, my lord, as long and sharp as yours.
   And so he spoke, and so he spoke, that lord of Castamere,
   But now the rains weep o'er his hall, with no one there to hear.
   Yes now the rains weep o'er his hall, and not a soul to hear.

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — The [31]Tennessee Titans have released safety
   [32]Michael Griffin after nine seasons in their first step toward
   improving their secondary.

   The Titans announced the move Tuesday.

   A first-round draft pick in 2007 at No. 19 overall out of Texas,
   Griffin was a two-time Pro Bowl pick in 2008 and 2010 whose 141 games
   played tied [33]Corey Graham of Buffalo for most games played by a
   safety between 2007 and 2015. Griffin had 25 interceptions and also
   became the fifth player in franchise history with 900 career tackles
   and the most by a safety.

   Griffin wrote on Twitter that he knew his time would come.

   He wrote, ”I cherished every minute of it. It’s been real Tennessee.
   Thanks for everything. (hash)nextchapter.”

   (UPDATED on 2/8/16 at 3 p.m. ET. Jon Jones’ rep said she misspoke when
   originally claiming Jones was speeding.)

   A rep for [35]Jon Jones said the former former light-heavyweight
   champion was pulled over for a minor traffic infraction and “fully
   cooperated” before being issued a citation.

   Denise White, CEO of Jones’ PR and crisis management firm, EAG Sports,
   initially told MMAjunkie the fighter was pulled over for speeding, but
   later clarified she “misspoke” and said she didn’t know why he was
   pulled over.

   “He will be in traffic court on Wednesday like everyone else that gets
   a ticket,“ White said. “He is fully licensed and insured.”

   Jones, 28, was cited for [36]driving without a driver’s license, proof
   of insurance or registration. He is due in Albuquerque Metropolitan
   court on Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. MT.

   The traffic trouble is potentially problematic for Jones, who’s
   scheduled to headline UFC 197 in April, because he’s still serving
   [37]18 months of supervised probation that was ordered with a plea
   agreement stemming from a hit-and-run accident. Under the terms of his
   probation, he is forbidden from breaking any laws.

   The Albuquerque district attorney’s office and UFC officials said they
   are looking into the issue.

   “Our office has the discretion to pursue a revocation of probation if
   an alleged incident arises to the level of a substantial violation of
   probation,” wrote Kayla Anderson, public information officer for
   Albuquerque’s second judicial district attorney’s office. “Our office
   makes that determination after we have examined all the facts
   surrounding the incident. As of today, we do not have enough
   information about the Jan. 31 incident to make that determination, but
   we will examine the matter.”

   It’s unclear whether UFC officials were aware of Jones’ current trouble
   when they announced his rematch with champ Daniel Cormier at UFC 197,
   which takes place April 23 in Las Vegas.

   Jones (21-1 MMA, 15-1 UFC) hopes to win back the title that was
   stripped by the promotion in the wake of his accident. He hasn’t fought
   since defending his belt against Cormier (17-1 MMA, 6-1 UFC), who went
   on to win the vacant belt, at UFC 182.

   As MMAjunkie reported earlier today, Jones has been [38]repeatedly
   cited for driving infractions and once pled guilty to driving while
   intoxicated. But according to White, he is making a concerted effort to
   turn around his life and [39]pass on a message of positivity while
   fulfilling the terms of his probation, which include giving 72 public
   speaking engagements.

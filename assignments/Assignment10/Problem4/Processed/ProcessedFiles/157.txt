   Princess Diana, Best Looks

   Tim Graham/Getty Images

   It's safe to say [34]Princess Diana completely revived British fashion
   for the royal family in the 1990s, even paving the way for [35]Kate
   Middleton's stylish impact today. Now, some of those incredibly iconic
   looks are getting their own display at a new exhibit in Kensington
   Palace.

   The [36]Fashion Rules Restyled exhibition—which was first launched
   several years ago and is now seeing a reincarnation—not only boasts
   tribute to Princess Diana and her game-changing style, but also to the
   late Princess Margaret and [37]Queen Elizabeth II, as they are arguably
   the three most watched royals of all time.

   Diana's display will explore how her wardrobe had the [39]power to set
   trends both at home and abroad and represented a truly modern, revamped
   royal style that would change the platform of British fashion forever.

   The exhibit will include two of the Princess' favorite designers, Bruce
   Oldfield and Catherine Walker, as well as several of her
   [40]most-talked about ensembles: the black, velvet Balmoral gown and
   the green, double-breasted dress that was later made famous by Mario
   Testino's photographs.

   Libby Thompson, Historic Royal Palaces curator, [41]said in a
   statement: "Fashion Rules has proved popular with our visitors, and
   we're delighted to be able to expand on this theme to celebrate the
   style evolution of three iconic modern royal women."

   She continued, "The new display will delve even deeper into the royal
   wardrobe, revealing some real surprises that I hope will challenge the
   way we think of royal style."

   The exhibit will officially open on Feb. 11.

Duke QB Thomas Sirk ruptures Achilles during team workout

   Duke QB Thomas Sirk ruptures Achilles during team workout Photo: AP
   Photo/Seth Wenig
   by [241]SI Wire
   [242]Email
   Posted: Tue Feb. 9, 2016

   Duke quarterback Thomas Sirk sustained a ruptured left Achilles during
   a team workout on Tuesday morning, the school [243]announced.

   There is no timetable for his return, but he is expected to undergo
   surgery on Wednesday.

   Sirk missed the 2013 with a ruptured right Achilles.

   As a junior last year, Sirk started 12 games and recorded 3,428 total
   yards, the second most in a single season by a Blue Devils quarterback.
   Parker Boehme, who started one game last year, may fill in Sirk’s
   absence if the quarterback misses extended time during the 2016 season.

   • [244]Which new coaches won on National Signing Day 2016?

   Duke finished last season 8–5 with a victory in the Pinstripe Bowl over
   the Indiana Hoosiers.

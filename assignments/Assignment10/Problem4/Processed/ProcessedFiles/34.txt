   DETROIT – The Detroit Red Wings have strung together two strong games
   back-to-back, so there is no reason to change anything.

   And coach Jeff Blashill confirmed after Tuesday's practice that he's
   using the same lineup for Wednesday's game against the Ottawa Senators
   at Joe Louis Arena (7 p.m., Fox Sports Detroit).

   It will be the Senators debut for defenseman Dion Phaneuf, acquired
   today in a blockbuster deal with the Toronto Maple Leafs.

   "He's been a really good defenseman in this league for a long time,"
   Blashill said. "It'll improve their D corps for right now. They're
   trying to make a push to make the playoffs. It certainly adds a big
   defenseman who's physical and I thought was having a real good year. So
   it'll make what I thought was a difficult challenge even more
   challenging."

   The Red Wings had some interest in acquiring Phaneuf at last year's
   trade deadline but couldn't get the Maple Leafs to retain of a portion
   of his contract, which has a $7 million salary cap hit and runs through
   2020-21.

   "It's always interesting games when we play (Ottawa); it's high-paced
   and most of the time it's high-scoring games," Henrik Zetterberg said.
   "Him coming in with a veteran's presence, been in the league for a long
   time, and it just adds to the depth on their blue line. Erik Karlsson
   is probably one of the best defenseman in the league and then you add
   Phaneuf. It will definitely help their team."

   The Red Wings' anticipated lines for Wednesday:

   Justin Abdelkader-Pavel Datsyuk-Henrik Zetterberg

   Tomas Tatar-Dylan Larkin-Brad Richards

   Tomas Jurco-Andreas Athanasiou-Gustav Nyquist

   Darren Helm-Luke Glendening-Riley Sheahan

   Teemu Pulkkinen, Joakim Andersson (scratches)

   On defense:

   Kyle Quincey-Danny DeKeyser

   Brendan Smith-Jakub Kindl

   Jonathan Ericsson-Alexey Marchenko

   In goal:

   Petr Mrazek (starting)

   Jimmy Howard

   RED WINGS NOTES

   No punishment for Abdelkader: Justin Abdelkader did not have a hearing
   with the NHL or receive any supplemental disciple for his check on
   Florida's Aleksander Barkov during the second period of Monday's 3-0
   win. Barkov left the game due to concussion protocol and won't play
   tonight in Buffalo. "We don't want anybody getting hurt ... but I
   thought it was an absolutely clean hit," Blashill said. "From my
   definition of what's a great hit in hockey today, it was through the
   body, it didn't spin him at all. All the things I've been told that
   would cause it to be a potential suspension, none of it was there. I
   thought it was an absolute clean hit and it doesn't surprise me there
   wasn't a hearing."

   Kronwall skating: Niklas Kronwall has skated the past two days by
   himself, after having his knee scoped on Jan. 18. Blashill said he
   might practice by the end of the week. He's eligible to come off
   long-term injured reserve on Sunday but probably won't be back in the
   lineup until later next week.

   Green still out: Mike Green hasn't skated the past couple of days and
   will miss his second game in a row due to a groin injury, which
   typically idles a player for at least a week to 10 days.

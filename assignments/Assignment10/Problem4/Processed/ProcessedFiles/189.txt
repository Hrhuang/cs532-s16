Houston Texans player: Cryotherapy provides relief off the field

   By [157]Rachel McNeill - Anchor
   Posted: 7:10 AM, February 09, 2016 Updated: 7:27 AM, February 09, 2016

    A non-invasive hyper-cooling treatment is becoming wildly popular
   among those seeking quick pain relief, a boost of energy and much
   more.  For one well-known local athlete, it's been life-changing.

   Houston Texans linebacker Brian Cushing is no stranger to hard knocks.
   He has taken some big hits and it's taken its toll.

   That's when other pro athletes told him about cryotherapy.

   Cushing told KPRC Channel 2, "First time I tried it was in 2011. I went
   to the (Houston) Rockets facility and they were nice enough to let me
   use it and I just noticed right away how impactful it was."

   [158]Glo Sun Spa co-owner Cristina Cooker said many people are drawn to
   the cryochamber because it boosts your energy while decreasing
   inflammation.

   Cooker said, "We have got many people that come in for injuries. So
   you've got muscle, tendon, joint pain.  It's really great for that.
   It's really, really good for anti-aging. It boosts your metabolism.
   From a wellness aspect, it's really great for stress, anxiety. It helps
   people with insomnia sleep better."

   Clients stay in the chamber for up to three minutes, if you can stand
   it!

   Cooker explained, "(The cryochamber) fills up with nitrogen oxide. That
   air that surrounds you is negative 220 degrees. It brings your skin
   down to 30 degrees."

   The first time was a shocker for Cushing.

   He said, "Cold! Very cold! I was a little shocked how cold it was, but
   it's one of those things you get used to as the time went along. The
   benefits that I got, I thought it was something that was very good for
   me."

   Cushing said he steps in the cryochamber about three times a week.

   He explained, "The soreness, the aches, the body aches, the things from
   playing football and being an athlete were diminishing becoming less
   and less and that was something I was grateful for."

   He added, "Just do it.  Don't think too much about it. Just get in
   there and it'll be over soon enough!

   Cryotherapy sessions at Glo Sun Spa cost 20 dollars the first time,
   then 65 dollars per session.

   Packages are also available.

   Cryotherapy is not yet FDA approved as a medical treatment, so talk to
   your doctor before trying it.

Top 3 Tech Innovations That Will Change The Future of Sports

   The NFL & TechCrunch set out to find the most promising startups and
   technology that will advance the stadium experience, better the
   enjoyment of live sports broadcasts at home, and create the biggest
   impact on performance and safety of athletes. The result was [3]1st and
   Future, a startup competition that aimed to disrupt the future of
   sports. Here are the top 3 tech innovations that will change sports
   forever:
    1. The Future Stadium Winner: HYP3R
       Sporting events are massive sources of social media updates, but
       more often than not, these updates go out without hashtags or other
       identifying marks. [4]HYP3R’s location-based dashboard helps
       stakeholders and sponsors identify these posts, allowing them to
       engage with audiences in unique ways (such as sending a “Welcome to
       the arena!” message the first time it identifies a visitor.)
       Additionally, HYP3R provides a CRM to identify repeat visitors and
       notable social media influencers that are posting from the venue.
    2. Bringing Home the Game Winner: LiveLike’s VR Spectator App
       [5]LiveLike lets fans experience the game like never before through
       their very own VR box suite. They can view several angles at once,
       or get up close and personal to feel like they’re actually sitting
       on the edge of the field or court from behind the goal or the
       50-yard line. Also, friends can watch together side by side so they
       can experience the game from the VR suite together.
    3. Future Athlete Winner: Kenzen
       [6]Kenzen delivers real-time health insights using patented
       biosensors, sweat analysis and predictive analytics with the aim of
       preempting dehydration, cramping, and injuries. The startup offers
       an “echo smart patch,” which is a wearable biosensor that measures
       vital signs, fluids and nutrients, motion and environment. Kenzen’s
       app accompanies the patch and shows hydration and ion levels to the
       user. It will also send alerts to players whenever they fall into a
       critical zone such as low hydration levels while on the field,
       which can help avoid injury and aid recovery.

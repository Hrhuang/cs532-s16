How to Make Your Game a Hit at Gen Con

   February 2016    [21]Business, [22]Publishing

   As part of my series on publishing your games, I’m excited to interview
   Scott Elliott, game industry veteran, VP of Business Development at
   Gen Con, and long-time friend.   While my last article focused on using
   conventions to pitch your tabletop game to other publishers, Scott
   focuses on how you can self-publish and get the word out at Gen Con.

   I can tell you from personal experience that his strategies work.
   Stone Blade Entertainment launched its first game at Gen Con 2010, and
   our success there provided the foundation for the company today.  There
   is nothing more exciting than the feeling of players first getting to
   demo and purchase your game, and for tabletop games, Gen Con is the
   best place to experience that.

   Gen Con is sold out for exhibitor space this year, but if you want a
   chance to attend Gen Con 2016 to game, network, and plan your presence
   at Gen Con 2017, all you have to do is [23]sign up for a chance to win
   a free 4 day pass!

   Even if you aren’t going to Gen Con, many of Scott’s tips will be
   valuable to you.  There is a lot of great info in this interview,
   including:
     * How Scott got his start in the gaming industry
     * Timeline to ship and market your game leading up to a convention
     * How to apply for and get a Gen Con Marketing Fellowship
     * Logistics of a successful booth
     * Costs to exhibit and tips for presence at the show
     * How to contact Scott and others at Gen Con staff for more
       information

   For anyone who aspires to publish their own tabletop games, use the
   below tips to set a concrete timeline now for 2017.  Deadlines have a
   magic power to help turn aspirations into realities.  Set one now and
   start filling in the gaps between idea and product.  I’ll give more
   tips on the publishing process (including insight into Kickstarter and
   other crowdfunding options) in the weeks and months ahead to help you
   along the path.  If you’ve ever thought about starting your own game
   company, think about the next 18 months as your window to make it
   happen.

   Thanks for taking the time to answer these questions.  You and I have
   known each other for a long time, but for those in our audience who
   don’t know you can you please introduce yourself?

   SE: In the early 1990s, like many others, I fell in love with Magic:
   the Gathering. I enjoyed competitive play, but found that I was a
   better event organizer and judge, so that’s where I focused my efforts,
   eventually advancing to become a level 3 judge, judging nationals, Pro
   Tours, Grand Prixs and so on. I organized tournaments in the St. Louis
   region in the early 2000s, including an invitational series. Fun times!
   All that experience led to an opportunity in the games industry with
   Upper Deck. I managed organized play and was directly involved in games
   rules systems, the judge program, and had a small role (as did most of
   us non-designers there) in game development. After six years at UD, I
   joined the team at Gen Con in 2009.

   During my time at Gen Con I have had the privilege of helping to coach
   hundreds of game companies on strategies and tactics for success. My
   current title is Vice President of Business Development and some of my
   day-to-day work involves helping exhibitors and sponsors plan for their
   presences at the show, licensing the Gen Con brand, and planning the
   Georgia Street festival area of the show, where we have
   larger-than-life gaming, bands, a beer garden, and food trucks.

   I owe a lot of my company’s success to our initial presence at Gen Con
   2010.  For an aspiring game designer / publisher, how can Gen Con help
   them succeed in the industry?

   SE: Stone Blade’s initial presence at Gen Con in 2010 was a knockout.
   There was tons of buzz about [26]Ascension at the show. There were
   pretty specific reasons why you guys were so successful at Gen Con.
   2010 was the year that Gen Con launched the Marketing Fellowship
   Program, as a component of Entrepreneurs’ Avenue. For those that don’t
   know, Entrepreneurs’ Avenue is an area in the exhibit hall where
   companies that have no priority points (meaning they have not exhibited
   at Gen Con in the last four years) have the chance to secure a single
   one hundred square foot (SQFT) booth for $1,000. It is hands-down the
   best deal in event marketing for games. The Marketing Fellowship
   program requires companies to submit a presentation explaining how they
   will succeed at Gen Con. The application process is really intended to
   provide new companies with a simple list of questions that they need to
   answer for themselves, in order to be successful at the show. As an
   incremental benefit for being among the best applicants, six companies
   are chosen annually to have their booth bumped up to a two hundred SQFT
   booth, and to receive some additional free advertising to help drive
   traffic to their booths.

   The choices that Stone Blade made to be successful at Gen Con are a
   good roadmap for others to follow to succeed there, too.
    1. Highlight your strengths! Stone Blade focused on presenting your
       interesting art, world-class game designers (which implied
       world-class game design), and storyline.
    2. Hit your milestones for advertising success! Advertising for your
       presence at Gen Con is important in three phases, and with three
       audiences.

   Early phase: (January – May) Preaching to the converted. Activate your
   base. Telling your existing fans early that you will be attending Gen
   Con will help you considerably. These folks will be able to help spread
   the word from mouth-to-ear that their favorite game is going to be
   showcased and available to buy and play at the show. This is also the
   time of year when you will need to confirm that you have a base of demo
   team members available to help at the show. Your demo folks are almost
   always drawn from early adopters or superfans anyway, so you are being
   efficient and smart with your communications, by ensuring you tell them
   first.

   Peak advertising phase: (May – August) Speaking to the masses. This is
   the time of year when spending real advertising dollars on social media
   ads and activating Gen Con’s marketing elements is a top priority for
   the majority of companies that advertise their presences through Gen
   Con’s official marketing channels. Now, admittedly, I have a
   profit-driven reason to say these things are good, since they directly
   benefit me and my employer. Nonetheless, I can tell you that we also
   have math to support this idea. Gen Con’s email newsletter (yes,
   email-based marketing is alive and well!) has an open rate that is
   often in the 30-40% range, and we see that convert into hundreds or
   thousands of clicks per link. Companies investing in our email
   advertising for their KickStarter campaigns have shared with us the
   visible spikes in their backers after our emails go out.

   Onsite advertising phase: (Annual show dates) Onsite advertising is
   more important for companies with multiple games or brands represented,
   and for companies with larger dedicated booth footprints or event
   schedules. Much of the preparation for this phase requires 1:1 coaching
   from the Gen Con team.

   Since Gen Con’s exhibit hall sells out completely every year, it will
   be important to contact [28]exhibitors@gencon.com during August to
   inquire about being included among companies interested in space in the
   exhibit hall, whether in Entrepreneurs’ Avenue, or in the general
   exhibit hall.

   Why do you think Gen Con has become such an icon in hobby gaming?
   SE: I don’t think it’s a stretch to say that contemporary hobby gaming,
   just like the modern Gen Con itself, wouldn’t be around, if it weren’t
   for the history of Gen Con and its role as a key place to launch new
   games & new expansions. There is a great intersection of eager hobby
   gamers who want to be the first to have the newest-to-market games, and
   companies who want to see the marketplace seeded by excited game
   players, who will spread the good news about the best and brightest
   game offerings during the time of year when many folks are planning for
   their holiday shopping later that fall. Alongside those core gamers we
   have seen thousands of new-to-Gen Con attendees from the Midwest
   region, and beyond. Those moms, dads, grandparents, and kids represent
   the future of gaming, and become hobby gamers by means of being
   introduced to the community at Gen Con.

   Seeing attendees and demo experts teaching new players and kids how to
   play their most-favorite games is one of my favorite things.

   For someone looking to debut a game in Gen Con 2017, what do you
   recommend they start doing now?

   SE: It’s never too early to work on scripting and practicing your game
   demos. As a salesman of games, when I did game pitches, I would work up
   a 30 second, 90 second, and three minute demo of any game I was trying
   to sell. The assumption is that you and your demo team will be able to
   shift into a longer-form demo, should the attendee show enough
   interest. It’s so important to be able to capture their attention and
   get right to the fun quickly in product demos, just like it is in
   elegant game design.

   Changing gears to focus on production: Do anything you can to ensure
   that you pull your production schedule forward far enough that you have
   product landed in the US and clear of customs in time for slow-shipment
   by land to Gen Con. Seeing companies waste thousands of dollars to
   air-freight late product bums me out – and it is one of the easiest
   ways to help protect your margin. Don’t blow it on shipping!

   Keep an eye on what advertising you see in Gen Con’s email newsletter
   for 2016. This will help to give you an idea of what other companies
   are doing now. Nothing better than learning from those more
   experienced, and improving their ideas. You can sign up for our
   [30]newsletter here.

   Start working on a plan for the layout of a 10×10 booth and a 10×20
   booth. If you have the space to mock it up in a garage or office
   storage room, it is helpful to see what can actually fit in that size
   space. I like to do banner production in advance, so there is time to
   place it in my booth mockup, and see how it looks, check line-of-sight,
   etc. Building out a booth mockup will teach you a lot, and if you have
   actual pictures of your mocked-up booth, those will be assets that you
   can include as part of your booth application.

   How can someone best set themselves up for success at Gen Con?

   SE: Prepare early. Build a timeline, and follow it. Build a budget. Ask
   questions, even if you think they seem too simple or embarrassing to
   ask.

   Plan for 50% more booth staff than you think you need. Otherwise, you
   will get sick from missing bio breaks and rest breaks.

   Sleep sometimes.

   How can my readers best connect with you or other Gen Con
   representatives?

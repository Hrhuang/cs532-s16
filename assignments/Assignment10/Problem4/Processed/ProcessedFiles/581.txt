   The Sports Star of the Year awards event is Wednesday at the Paramount
   Theatre. To get you in the mood, check out this historical accounting
   of feats and deeds in Washington sports.

   things that happened in sports around our state. The feats, awards and
   career achievements cited here are part of the legacy celebrated by the
   longest-running awards event of its kind in the nation.

   Boston (now Atlanta) Braves. Incredibly, Boston pitcher Joe Oeschger
   also threw all 26 innings. The game was called due to darkness with the

   league record for innings pitched.

   27 Scoring average for Seattle University’s [62]Elgin Baylor in the
   1957-58 NCAA basketball tournament. Baylor was named Most Outstanding

   fame.

   39 PCL record for pitching victories in one season, held by [75]Rube

   set two other remarkable PCL records in ’06 with 411 strikeouts and
   518.2 innings pitched.

   40 Career high for home runs by Spokane native [76]Ryne Sandberg
   (1990). The Hall of Fame second baseman turned down a football
   scholarship at WSU after starring at quarterback for North Central.

   when he threw a perfect game against the PCL’s Sacramento Solons in
   1948.

   sports.

   55 Conference wins for[91] Marv Harshman in 13 seasons as Washington
   State’s basketball coach. Unfazed by Harshman’s 55-76 conference record

   Pullman in 1971. The Lake Stevens High alum, who starred in basketball

   57 Games needed for [93]Jeanne Eggart to score 1,000 points, the
   fastest the feat has been accomplished in Washington State women’s
   basketball history. Eggart, a Walla Walla High graduate, holds numerous
   WSU records more than three decades after her career ended in 1981-82.

   58 Age of Hall of Fame jockey[94] Russell Baze, who has won and rode in
   more horse races than any jockey in North American history. Baze grew
   up in Yakima, where he posted his first career victory.

   Marzetta – now sportscaster [95]Angie Mentink of Root Sports – in 1993.

   60 Mariners record for stolen bases in a season, set by [96]Harold
   Reynolds in 1987.

   61 Consecutive-games hitting streak — longest in PCL history — that
   18-year-old[97] Joe DiMaggio was building when he went 0-for-4 with
   three strikeouts against Spokane semipro pitcher Eddie Gesselman in a
   1933 exhibition game in Spokane. DiMaggio was playing with the San
   Francisco Seals prior to his Hall of Fame career with the New York
   Yankees.

   64 Consecutive games without a loss for the [100]Huskies football team
   from 1907-17 (60-0-4). The streak is a major college record. Coach Gil
   Dobie went undefeated (59-0-3) during his entire stay at Washington,
   from 1908-16. In fact, Dobie didn’t suffer his first loss as a college
   football coach until his 71st game. He went 8-0 in two years at North
   Dakota State prior to coming to Washington, then won his first game
   with Navy in 1917 before losing the next time out to West Virginia.

   65 [101]Sounders record for goals in an MLS season (in 34 games in
   2014).

   66 Career high for pass attempts in a college game by [102]Washington

   midway through the 2013 season in coach Mike Leach’s pass-happy
   offense.

   67 [103]Conseutive games won by Bellevue High before losing to Eastside
   Catholic of Sammamish, 35-13, in the 2014 Class 3A state title game.

   football, and remains the longest in Washington high school football
   history.

   68 Minor league games played by Hall of Fame shortstop [104]Ozzie
   Smith, all with Walla Walla in the Northwest League in 1977. The
   following year, the Cal Poly product made the huge jump from
   short-season Class A to the majors and started all season for the San
   Diego Padres.

   Helene Madison, wearing a Washington Athletic Club top, won three gold
   medals in the 1932 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, thanks to the training

   Olympic record in the 100-meter freestyle at Los Angeles in 1932.

   seconds. The Lincoln (Seattle) High graduate also won gold medals in
   the 400 freestyle (setting a world record of 5:28.5) and the 400 relay.

   70 [106]Games over .500 the Mariners finished in 2001. Manager Lou

   before he was forced to retire after two seasons due to ulcers. McCool
   left school during Gonzaga’s brief run in major college hockey to turn
   pro with the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1944-45. McCool won the Calder
   Trophy as the NHL’s rookie of the year and helped the Leafs capture the
   Stanley Cup.

   the third round of the 2012 NFL draft.

   75 Years since [111]Washington State won a conference championship in
   men’s basketball. The Cougars won the Pacific Coast (now Pac-12)
   Conference and made it to the 1940-41 NCAA title game before losing to
   Wisconsin. If you think 75 years is a long time for WSU fans to wait
   for another conference basketball title, consider that it’s been 100
   years since the Cougars produced their only Rose Bowl win (14-0 over
   Brown in 1916).

   mask – in the original (pro) WHL in 1961-62.

   85 Percentage of games won (.854, counting the playoffs) by the
   [121]2010 Seattle Storm. The winning percentage is the highest in

   7-0 in the playoffs, to claim the WNBA championship.

   86 Seahawks career record for coaching wins, held by [122]Mike Holmgren
   (86-74 from 1999-2008).

   87 Victories in 91 college wrestling matches for Washington’s
   [123]Larry Owings, whose 1969-70 NCAA championship resulted in the only
   college loss by the legendary Dan Gable. The loss, in Gable’s final
   match at Iowa State, left the wrestling legend with a 181-1 record in
   high school and college.

   88 NFL games (counting the playoffs) played by[124] Turk Edwards, a pro
   and college football hall of famer out of Clarkston High and Washington

   pre-game coin toss.

   [125]Connor Halliday at Oregon in 2013. Halliday, who starred at Ferris

   to the Memorial Cup title. The Memorial Cup tournament determines the
   major junior (20-and-under) champions of North America.

   92 Major league wins recorded by [128]Vean Gregg, who won 20 or more
   games in each of his first three seasons in the majors. Gregg spent
   much of his youth in the Chehalis and Clarkston areas. After his
   impressive start with the Cleveland Indians, arm problems shortened his
   career. He had a 92-63 record.

   93 Largest margin of victory for a [129]Huskies basketball team.
   Washington laid the wood to College of Puget Sound, 100-7, in 1921.

   94 Wins for the [130]1970 Spokane Indians, led by future Hall of Fame
   manager Tommy Lasorda. Spokane finished 94-52 and won the PCL title.
   Key players included longtime major leaguers Steve Garvey, Bill
   Buckner, Davey Lopes, Bill Russell, Doyle Alexander and Charlie Hough.

   Cortez Kennedy usually wore No. 96, but in honor of his late college
   teammate, Jerome Brown, switched to 99 in 1992. / Seahawks

   95 Career hits in the big leagues for the[131] Mariners’ five
   first-round draft picks (all position players) in the five amateur
   drafts held from January 1978 to January 1980. Only Jim Maler and Al
   Chambers reached the majors.

   96 Points scored in the regular season by Spokane Flyers scoring leader
   [132]Roy McBride in 1948-49, when the Flyers won the U.S. senior
   amateur hockey championship. Spokane teams later won four Allan Cups as
   the first U.S.-based senior amateur champions of North America.

   97 Seahawks career record for quarterback sacks (97.5), held by

   in a car accident that year. Kennedy and Brown were friends since

   his 10 other NFL seasons (all with the Seahawks), won the NFL Defensive
   Player of the Year Award wearing No. 99.

       Appreciate the Metropolitans picture leading things off. Still
       holding out tiny bit of hope the NHL returns to the Emerald City.
          + art thiel
            I think Howie covered a whole lot of ground on both sides of
            the state.
     * Pixdawg13
       Couple of boo-boos in this fun piece. Pic shows Tez wearing 96 and
       the cut line says he wore 96 in honor of Jerome Brown, contrary to
       the text and the facts. The numbers for the UW’s unbeaten streak
       don’t match either the cut line of the Dobie pic or the boldface
       numbers in the text. The Dobie pic # is doubtless HIS record as UW
       coach.
       Fun piece this is, though.
          + art thiel
            Thanks, Pix. Fixed. Dobie’s undefeated streak is 70, which is
            a new/corrected entry. He was 8-0 in North Dakota, 58-0-3 at
            UW and won his 1917 opener at Navy before losing to W. Va. The
            cutline was correct.
     * Tian Biao
       excellent article, very interesting, thanks! I learned a lot too,
       which is saying something, given how closely I seem to follow
       Seattle sports, at least according to the rest of the family.
          + art thiel
            Glad you enjoyed. Yell your friends.
     * Kirkland
       Glen Goodall had a fabulous scoring career with the Thunderbirds,
       but had the misfortune to be a generous 5’9″ when the NHL preferred
       hulks. If he were playing today, with the pros limiting the
       clutch-and-grab strategies and small guys like Tyler Johnson
       succeeding, I’d be willing to bet he’d have a good career here
       instead of playing in Germany’s league as he ended up doing.
     * David Michel
       Pretty cool list!

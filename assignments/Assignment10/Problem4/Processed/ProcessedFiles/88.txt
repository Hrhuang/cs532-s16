   In Week 4 of the Canadian Lacrosse League season, the Paris-based team
   dropped a 14-11 decision to the Ohsweken Demons on Friday and a 12-8
   game to the Barrie Blizzard on Sunday.

   The Cyclops were outscored by a combined 7-0 in the first quarters of
   both games.

   In fact, on Friday in Ohsweken at the Iroquois Lacrosse Arena, the
   Cyclops didn’t solve Demons rookie goaltender Gowah Abrams until
   partway through the second quarter when they were already down 7-0.

   The Cyclops mounted a comeback attempt, pulling within one goal early
   in the fourth quarter, but the Demons replied with four straight goals
   of their own to re-establish their lead.

   Cyclops star forward Dan Keane scored a hat trick in the final three
   and a half minutes of the game, but it wasn’t enough to close the 14-11
   final.

   The Blizzard had similar control over the Cyclops early in Sunday’s
   game, leading 3-0 after one quarter and 8-3 at halftime.

   Keane had another hat trick on Sunday, giving him eight goals on the
   weekend. He is currently tied for second in CLAX for scoring with 14
   goals and 14 assists in six games.

   Jordan Dance, who shares the court with Keane on offence, is tied for
   fourth in the league with 15 goals and 12 assists.

   The Cyclops fall to 2-4 with the losses, but the five-team league
   remains tightly bunched with all teams within a win of first place.

   The Cyclops added free-agent Graham Bergsma to the roster on Tuesday,
   singing the transition player from Toronto following his release by the
   Barrie Blizzard.

   Bergsma played two seasons in CLAX for the Durham Turfdogs in 2012 and
   2013 before sitting out the past two seasons.

   The Cyclops have a weekend off before hosting the Demons on Friday,
   Feb. 19, at the Syl Apps Community Centre in Paris at 7:30 p.m.

   Released today for the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, Arslan: The Warriors
   of Legend is based on the anime of a manga adaptation of a series of
   Japanese fantasy novels that themselves are based on a Persian epic.
   None of that matters as long as you enjoy Dynasty Warriors games.

   If you’re not sure, watch us play it in the video above. It’s what we
   played it for.

   I certainly didn’t know anything about the origins of the latest game
   from Omega Force, the developer behind Dynasty Warriors and its various
   spin-offs, as well as licensed massive action battle games like Hyrule
   Warriors and Dragon Quest Heroes. Apparently the anime has been running
   for one season and is due for a second, but it doesn’t show up on the
   streaming anime service I subscribe to so it might as well not exist.

   So why am I playing it? Well, for one its cel-shaded graphics were
   pretty enough to catch my eye. And secondly, I’m a fan of the Musou
   series. Any chance I get to be one character against a ton of
   characters while non-player characters in my army mill about doing
   nothing? I’ll take it.

   the normal age.

   And the Arslan: The Warriors of Legend is an excellent Musou game. It’s
   highly polished, like all of Omega Force’s third party efforts. The two
   button combo system is simple and lovely to fight with. At certain
   times I get to gather my forces to charge the enemy with massive
   numbers.
   Even Obscure Anime Can Become A Good Dynasty Warriors Game Bad. Ass.

   If you really want to know the story of The Heroic Legend of Arslan
   it’s all here, presented anime cutscene style. If you don’t, you’ll
   still have a lot of fun online and off, as long as your idea of fun is
   cutting through hordes of same-looking enemies.

   I know mine is.

   CORRECTION - 4:30pm: The development studio is called Omega Force, not
   Q-Force. Apologies for the mistake.

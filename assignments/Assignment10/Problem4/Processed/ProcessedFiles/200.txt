Lucic vs. Bruins: Hit ‘anybody that gets in the way’

   BOSTON – Milan Lucic was all smiles in the visiting Los Angeles Kings
   dressing room after taking his first twirl on the TD Garden ice as a
   non-home player at the morning skate Tuesday.

   Lucic skated with a smile on his face and a hello for many of the
   familiar faces he saw while going through the practice paces with his
   Kings teammates and there was a palpable excitement prior to suiting up
   for his first game vs. Boston after eight years as a diehard member of
   the Bruins.

   He certainly had that familiar twinkle in his eye when asked which
   Bruins player he’ll try to lay the first body check on once the puck is
   dropped.

   "Just anybody that gets in the way,” said Lucic. “That's the mentality
   that you have to have, right?"

   Clearly, though, the bruising left winger is hoping for a welcoming
   embrace from the fans at TD Garden, and a good, old-fashioned heavy
   hockey game that they appreciate most.

   “I think it’ll be a lot of fun. I think it’ll be a hard-fought game,
   and I think there’s a lot to look forward to for us at the start of a
   seven-game road trip. For myself, I get to play in the Garden as a
   visitor. It’s kind of weird being in the visiting locker room, but it’s
   nice to be back here in Boston,” said Milan Lucic. “It’s the place I
   started. You come here as a 19-year-old rookie, and when you have the
   success like I did a lot of things cross your mind. Especially when you
   get to achieve your ultimate dream of winning a Stanley Cup, and doing
   it with a group of guys that I got to do it with, and the organization
   that I got to do it with in the city with the fans and everything else.
   That’s what sticks out the most.

   “Getting to be a part of a Stanley Cup team on an Original Six team in
   a city where they really embrace their athletes and their sports teams
   [was special]. Those are the things that stick out in my mind, and
   really add to the emotion of tonight’s game.”

   Is Lucic hoping for a hero’s welcome from the Bruins fans as many other
   departed players from the 2011 Cup team have received in their first
   game back at the Garden?

   “It wouldn’t surprise me if they did [chant Looch!]. I think I had a
   pretty good relationship with the fans, and that’s what I said it’s
   exciting to be back here to play in front of them again,” said Lucic.
   “It’ll be different: different side, different room and getting ready
   for the game a little differently. But I just need to remind myself to
   approach this like any other road game where we’re trying to get two
   points tonight.”

   Were there any negative emotions from Lucic’s end when it came to being
   dealt away this summer after eight great years in Boston, or did he
   understand what was going to happen with the B’s coming off a
   disappointing season where they missed the playoffs?

   “Nothing negative. No hard feelings. Nothing like that. I understood
   the situation leading into the offseason, and sometimes things don’t
   last forever. I was ready and prepared for anything. I was ready and
   prepared to come back here, and I was ready and prepared if I had to
   move on,” said Lucic. “Luckily and thankfully I moved on to another
   really good team, and another contender. The Kings are a world class
   organization, and I’ve had a lot of fun in being a King so far.

   “I have no hard feelings about the trade, and there are definitely no
   regrets on my part in what I was able to accomplish [in Boston]. It’s
   just only good memories and good thoughts, and everything. I’m pretty
   fortunate that I got to be a Bruin in one of the best times to be a
   Bruin. They’ve only won six Cups in the 92 years that they’ve played,
   so it was a great time, and a special time, for me here, but I was also
   fortunate that I was able to move on to another great organization like
   the Kings.”

   It was odd seeing Lucic in the purple and gold Kings practice jerseys
   as they readied to don their original sweaters on Tuesday night to
   commemorate the 50th anniversary of LA being awarded the Kings
   franchise. Still, it will become all too real for Bruins players and
   fans alike once the first big Lucic hit is underway in that familiar
   spot in the corner, and once again that hulking physical presence has
   returned to the TD Garden ice.

   Here are all the links from around the hockey world, and what I’m
   reading, while pumped that Jon Bernthal is getting his own Netflix show
   as The Punisher. He was the best thing about the second season of
   Daredevil.

   *[43]Kevin Spacey is officially endorsing Aleksander Barkov for the
   cover EA Sports NHL 2017, and that continues the unlikely friendship
   between Spacey and the Florida Panthers.

   *[44]Patrick Kane knows that all eyes will be on him – for
   unfortunately good reasons -- moving forward with the Blackhawks after
   everything that went down with him on and off the ice over the last
   year.

   *In true hot take fashion, Ryan Lambert thinks [45]Bruce Boudreau
   should remain coach of the Ducks because he’s been unlucky in those
   pesky Game 7 playoff scenarios. Yup, it’s all about luck in sports.
   That must be why the Ducks fired him on Friday afternoon. So it’s
   another spot on piece of analysis from somebody that knows as much
   inside NHL hockey info as your local high school gym teacher.

   *Speaking of hot takes, FOH (Friend of Haggs) Rob Rossi says that
   [46]Tom Wilson isn’t a hockey player after his knee-on-knee hit of
   Connor Sheary in Game 1 of their playoff series. Wilson definitely
   isn’t as good a hockey player as Milan Lucic is in terms of offensive
   production, but he definitely can play the game of hockey a bit in
   addition to the thuggishness on the ice.

   *Gary Lawless says the[47] NHL and NHLPA have come to an agreement on
   players with no-movement clauses, who will need to be protected by
   their respective teams in any upcoming NHL expansion draft.

   *PHT writer and FOH (Friend of Haggs) Mike Halford says that
   [48]Russian wild card Alex Radulov is expecting to play in the NHL next
   season. That could be bad news to coaches everywhere looking to limit
   their quota of enigmatic Russian players on their roster.

   *ICYMI, here’s [49]my radio hit with Bob Stauffer from Oilers Now
   talking about the state of the Bruins as they head into the offseason.

   *For something completely different: the passing of [50]former Patriots
   player Ron Brace at 29 is so sad given what an excellent person he was
   in addition to being a solid local football product.

NHL Notes: McQuaid hopes Stamkos doesn’t rush back too soon

NHL Notes: McQuaid hopes Stamkos doesn’t rush back too soon

   By [55]Joe Haggerty [56]April 29, 2016 3:15 PM

   [57][pulse-article-sidebar.jpg] [58][pulse-ford-sidebar.jpg]
   [59]Advertisement

   The Tampa Bay Lightning has been decidedly vague about any potential
   return to the ice for Steven Stamkos in the Stanley Cup playoffs and
   that’s with excellent reason.

   Clearly, the Bolts could use Stamkos back as soon as possible while
   embroiled in a tough second-round matchup against the New York
   Islanders, but that doesn’t appear as if it’s going to happen with
   Tampa just four tantalizing wins away from a return to the Eastern
   Conference Final. The Lightning superstar has been out since April 4
   following his surgery for Thoracic Outlet Syndrome, a blood clot
   condition that involves an area at the collarbone that requires a
   fairly extensive surgery to repair.

   The surgery involves cutting the muscles around the clot, and
   permanently removing a rib.

   The original prognosis for Stamkos was a recovery time of 1-3 months.
   In an optimistic development, the 26-year-old has skated with his
   teammates for the past few days in a non-contact jersey. Stamos made it
   clear that he doesn’t know when he’ll be able to even get a chance to
   return and those that have gone through the same injury and surgery
   hope he does take his time.

   Bruins defenseman Adam McQuaid had the same Thoracic Outlet Syndrome
   blood clot issue and surgery in the lockout-shortened 2013 season, but
   his took place in  the first half of the schedule wiped out by the
   labor dispute. He was told at the time the injury was something
   extremely rare for a hockey player, but now he’s hearing of other cases
   around the league, including Stamkos and Andrei Vasilevskiy.

   “Everybody told me how rare it was for me to have this as a hockey
   player, and now there have been at least three other cases since,”
   McQuaid told CSNNE.com when asked about Stamkos at Bruins breakup day a
   couple of weeks ago. “It’s interesting. I don’t know if there’s a
   reason behind it. It can be a genetic thing where the space in there is
   a little smaller than somebody else, so somebody that doesn’t play
   sports or really lift weights won’t ever have an issue with it.

   “Or it can be a previous injury that’s changed the landscape of your
   anatomy. I’m not 100 percent sure what the case was for me, but those
   are the causes, I guess. It sounds like [Stamkos] had the exact same
   surgery I did, so we’ll see. I followed the doctor’s orders and I still
   feel like I pushed things a little bit, and it was two months on blood
   thinners. I couldn’t lift anything for a month, so it takes a while to
   get all of that back.”

   Regardless of how it happened, it took McQuaid multiple months to get
   off the blood thinners, get back to working and get on the ice for the
   first time, so he knows that any Stamkos return is later rather than
   sooner. It was also very clear to anybody who watched the rugged, rangy
   B’s blueliner in the 2013 abbreviated schedule that the extended period
   of time away from working out had a negative impact: McQuaid was
   seriously compromised in size and strength until getting a full summer
   to work back into peak condition.

   So, jumping onto a moving Stanley Cup playoff train is going to be
   awfully difficult, if not totally impossible, for even somebody as
   talented and gifted as Stamkos. It makes the one month end of the 1-3
   month timetable released by the Lightning at time of Stamkos’ injury
   announcement as much wishful thinking than anything expected to be a
   realistic return for Tampa Bay’s captain.

   McQuaid said he hopes Stamkos weighs his future when making the final
   decision on a possible return. Stamos’ status as an unrestricted free
   agent this summer really puts a different wrinkle into the unique
   scenario.

   “I guess I was somewhat fortunate because of the lockout that I didn’t
   miss any time,” said McQuaid, who had the symptoms crop up while
   driving from Boston to Prince Edward Island in late September 2012. “I
   know looking back now that I really needed to take the time to get my
   strength back. I know I wasn’t where I had been before the surgery when
   I came back [to play].

   “You’re a hockey player so you’re going to come back as soon as you can
   if you’re deep into the playoffs. You want to come back and do
   everything you can to help your team. But it can be a serious thing,
   you know? The blood clots. [Stamkos] is a great player with so many
   great years ahead of him. You’ve got to take the time to let your body
   heal and do things the right way so you won’t have issues down the road
   with it.”

   Nobody questions Stamkos’ toughness after he returned to Game 7 of the
   Eastern Conference Final against the Bruins in 2013 after a puck
   practically tore his nose off, and he’ll return if things fall into
   place. But here’s hoping valor doesn’t get in the way of common sense
   for a tough hockey player in Stamkos who should heed the words of
   McQuaid, who has been in the exact same difficult position.

   DEFENSEMEN FOR SALE

   It’s common knowledge to those that have covered the Bruins the past 10
   years that Don Sweeney and the B’s previously took a run at puck-moving
   defenseman Kevin Shattenkirk when he was traded from the Colorado
   Avalanche. The puck-moving defenseman was instead shipped to the St.
   Louis Blues, where he developed into an All-Star defenseman who’s still
   playing in the second round of the Western Conference playoffs against
   the Dallas Stars.

   But the former BU Terrier might not be sticking around in St. Louis for
   much longer.

   According to an industry source, the Bruins “are well-positioned to
   take a run at Shattenkirk” because of the D-man’s desire to play in the
   Eastern Conference if/when he is dealt by the Blues this summer.
   Shattenkirk doesn’t have a no-trade clause per se, but it might sweeten
   the trade return for St. Louis if they move him to a new club confident
   he’ll sign an extension with them.

   It also feels very much like something classy Blues GM Doug Armstrong
   would do in moving a good St. Louis soldier like Shattenkirk to a
   preferred NHL destination.

   With the Blues up against the salary cap with both David Backes and
   Jaden Schwartz up for new deals on July 1, Armstrong will be looking to
   deal a defenseman given the emergence of 22-year-old blueliner Colton
   Parayko. With Alex Pietrangelo, Jay Bouwmeester and Carl Gunnarsson all
   holding no-trade clauses, it doesn’t leave a lot of viable options for
   tradable assets from the quality D-men surplus aside from the
   27-year-old Shattenkirk.

   The one sticking point for the Bruins will be price.

   St. Louis and each of the other 28 NHL teams know that the Bruins are
   desperate for help on their back end, and that will be reflected in the
   premium price tag. Think something along the lines of the return to the
   Coyotes for a similar player in Keith Yandle: defenseman John Moore,
   top prospect Anthony Duclair, a lottery-protected first-round draft
   pick in 2016 and a second-round pick in 2015.

   What’s the Bruins equivalent? Perhaps Zach Trotman, Ryan Spooner and a
   conditional first/second round pick based on whether Shattenkirk ends
   up signing a contract extension to stick around Boston beyond next
   season.

   It makes perfect sense that the former BU defenseman could be one of
   the big blueline names moved this summer and the Bruins would register
   as a perfect fit given their need for a top-pairing puck-mover able to
   play 20-plus minutes a night with skill, production, precision and
   plenty of big-game poise.

   Shattenkirk has all of those things, and would perhaps begin to allow
   Cam Neely and Sweeney to start patching together a back end that
   destroyed the Bruins’ playoff hopes last season.

   ONE-TIMERS

   *I got a kick out of the Twitter puritans that swore Jeremy Roenick let
   a curse word slip on the air in his Thursday night analysis of Game 1
   between the Capitals and Penguins on NBCSN. Both Roenick and Mike
   Milbury were critical of the sloppiness and lack of defensive structure
   between the two teams, and JR called it basically a “shinny game” out
   on the ice.

   A lot of people thought he said something that sounds like “shinny” and
   might have also aptly described the action from a defensive purist
   standpoint. For those outside the hockey bubble, shinny is basically a
   pickup hockey game with no penalties, no real hitting and just rushes
   up and down the ice where offense is a premium.

   So, Roenick definitely said “shinny” in this instance, and I know this
   because I’ve also said “shinny” on the air only to have people think I
   was damning the torpedoes and swearing on the air. I actually had one
   viewer sending me angry emails that I was swearing while he and his son
   watched me on TV before I explained what I had actually said.

   So once and for all its “shinny,” people. Get your minds out of the
   gutter!

   *Speaking of the Capitals, they now become the heavy favorites to win
   the Stanley Cup in this humble hockey writer’s opinion with Western
   Conference heavyweights Los Angeles, Chicago and Anaheim now all
   eliminated from the postseason. Barry Trotz’s boys would be the first
   Eastern Conference team since the Bruins in 2011 to win the Cup if they
   can fully accomplish the mission at hand.

   *I think it’s time to officially retire the “Darth Quaider” nickname
   for Adam McQuaid with the Bruins signing Czech goaltender Daniel
   “Darth” Vladar to a three-year, entry-level contract. There can be only
   one Sith Lord per NHL team. Besides, McQuaid still has never even seen
   the Star Wars movies despite the moniker. So the Force is not strong in
   that one.

   Remember, keep shooting pucks at the net and good things are bound to
   happen.

Bruins' Patrice Bergeron named Selke finalist for fifth time

Bruins' Patrice Bergeron named Selke finalist for fifth time

   By [66]Joe Haggerty [67]April 28, 2016 10:15 PM

   [68][pulse-article-sidebar.jpg] [69][pulse-ford-sidebar.jpg]

   It was assumed that Patrice Bergeron will be finalist for the Selke
   Trophy again this season, and it became official on Thursday when it
   was announced that Bergeron, Ryan Kesler and Anze Kopitar were the
   three finalists for the award given to the best defensive forward.

   It would be the third straight Selke Trophy and fourth overall for
   Bergeron if he can take the hardware home again during the NHL Awards
   in June, and the ever-humble No. 37 said he was just honored to once
   again be nominated.

   “Being named a finalist for the Selke Trophy is a tremendous honor and
   one I am very grateful for,” said Bergeron in a press release. “While
   it is an individual award, my teammates and coaches deserve a lot of
   credit as well. Ryan and Anze are two elite players who both had great
   seasons and it is a privilege to be a finalist alongside them. Thanks
   to all of those who voted and I look forward to the NHL Awards Show on
   June 22.”

   The Bruins center has won the Selke Trophy three times (2012, 2014 and
   2015) and has now been a Selke finalist in each of the last five
   seasons. His three wins are tied for the second-most in NHL history,
   one behind Hall of Fame Canadiens forward Bob Gainey, who is the
   all-time leader with four Selke Trophies. Bergeron was the Bruins’ lone
   representative at the All-Star Game this winter for the second straight
   season, and was a no-brainer as a finalist given all of his defensive
   qualifications.

   Bergeron finished the 2015-16 regular season leading the NHL in
   faceoffs taken (1,978) and for the second straight season led the
   league in faceoffs won (1,130) while finishing a solid seventh overall
   with a 57.1% faceoff win rate among players taking a minimum of 500
   draws.

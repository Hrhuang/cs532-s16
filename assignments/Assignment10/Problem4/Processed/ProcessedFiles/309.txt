   Fifty years ago today, St. Louis got its foot in the door with the
   National Hockey League, gaining a conditional expansion franchise from
   the league’s Board of Governors.

   The Blues’ birth was unconventional, like much of the team’s subsequent
   history. Chicago Blackhawks owners James D. Norris and William Wirtz
   also owned the St. Louis Arena and wanted to sell. They saw the
   league’s expansion from six to 12 teams as their way to get value.

   So what if nobody here wanted a team? That small detail could be
   addressed later. Norris and Wirtz had pull. St. Louis got the NHL nod,
   over Baltimore, pending the recruitment of an owner.

   Sid Salomon Jr., his son Sid Salomon III and Robert Wolfson took on the
   challenge. They did it up right. They bought and renovated the Arena,
   at a cost of $6.5 million, paid the $2 million expansion fee and hired
   former Boston Bruins general manager Lynn Patrick.

   Patrick, in turn, hired up-and-comers Scotty Bowman and Cliff Fletcher
   from the Montreal Canadiens to lead his talent search. He gave another
   future NHL GM, Jimmy Devellano, his first job in scouting.

   Their leadership, combined with strong commitment from the Salomons,
   made the Blues a model franchise. They focused on defense and
   goaltending in the expansion draft, building around Jimmy Roberts, Noel
   Picard and Al Arbour at the blue line and Glenn Hall in the net.
   Subsequent deals brought rugged defensemen Bob and Barclay Plager,
   goal-scorer Red Berenson and another Hall of Fame goaltender, Jacques
   Plante.

   The team gained traction once Bowman replaced Patrick as coach. He
   began his NHL coaching career by coaxing productive twilight years from
   respected veterans while giving some younger players like the Plagers
   their opportunity.

   The good times lasted three seasons. The Blues reached the Stanley Cup
   Finals each time and set a high standard the franchise is still trying
   to meet today.

   Like Sid Salomon III, Blues Chairman Tom Stillman is trying to do it up
   right. His hockey operation is first-rate. General manager Doug
   Armstrong and coach Ken Hitchcock have glittering credentials,
   including Stanley Cups won elsewhere.

   Assistant GM Martin Brodeur and senior adviser Al MacInnis also have
   championship pedigrees. So does Brett Hull, who is helping over on the
   business side.

   When the Blues square off [112]against the Winnipeg Jets on Tuesday
   night at Scottrade Center — with Bob Plager dropping the ceremonial
   first puck, honoring this 50th birthday of sorts — they will be tied
   for fourth overall in the standings.

   Their goal is the same as it was five decades ago, to bring a Cup to
   St. Louis. But their path to the finals is much, much tougher.

   In those first three years the Blues needed only to play their way out
   of the expansion bracket to play for the Cup. The Original Six teams
   battled it out on the other side.

   These days the Western Conference is much tougher, with the Chicago
   Blackhawks and Los Angeles Kings operating mini-dynasties. The road to
   the finals is fraught with danger.

   Still, the qualities that separated the expansion-era Blues teams from
   the pack are worth emulating today. Those squads were hard to play
   against, featuring stellar goaltending, robust defensemen and the knack
   for timely goal-scoring.

   The Original Six powers swept them out of the Cup Finals in each visit,
   with Montreal beating them twice and Boston taking them out in the
   1969-70 Flying Orr Series. But the Blues showed well each time, turning
   most games into hard-fought affairs.

   What the current Blues have — and what those early teams lacked — is
   prime-age talent and depth. Back in the day Bowman had to resort to,
   say, talking the goal-scorer Dickie Moore out of retirement to lead one
   more playoff run.

   Much happened during the decades between the glorious early days and
   Stillman’s Cup quest. The franchise has suffered ownership collapses,
   managerial chaos, budget slashes, talent churn, stunningly bad luck,
   heartbreaking tragedy and one near-move to Saskatoon.

   One of the franchise’s most hated owners, Harry Ornest, helped save the
   franchise from oblivion. His Blues also came within two goals of
   playing for the Cup in 1986.

   One of the franchise’s most beloved chairmen, Mike Shanahan, operated
   willy-nilly. His hiring of oily-haired despot Mike Keenan set the Blues
   back for years.

   A billionaire, Bill Laurie, gutted the team and bailed after failing to
   land a NBA team to couple it with. A millionaire, Dave Checketts,
   stepped in and ran up huge deficits he couldn’t cover.

   A parade of all-time greats, including 10 of the top 40 scorers in NHL
   history, passed through the franchise. Most, like the great Wayne
   Gretzky, didn’t stay long.

   Future goal scorer Paul MacLean exited in a trade for defenseman Scott
   Campbell, who quickly retired with an asthma condition. Ornest ordered
   the departure of Joey Mullen and Mike Liut in salary dumps. Doug
   Gilmour was exiled after alleged adventures in babysitting.

   Judge Edward Houston swiped Scott Stevens to punish the Blues for
   signing Brendan Shanahan, who was later traded for Chris Pronger amid
   domestic turbulence. Pronger’s run here ended with the much-lamented
   Eric Brewer trade.

   Defenseman Ed Kea suffered a traumatic head injury during a game. First
   overall draft pick Erik Johnson wrecked his knee during golf cart high
   jinks.

   Rugged Bob Gassoff died in a motorcycle wreck after a team event. Lynn
   Patrick died of a heart attack after leaving a Blues game. Broadcaster
   Dan Kelly and “Monday Night Miracle” hero Doug Wickenheiser lost their
   cancer battles.

   Pavol Demitra and Igor Korolev died in a jet crash in Russia while
   traveling with their KHL team. Tough guy Todd Ewen recently took his
   own life.

   Through it all the franchise persevered. The latest bit of Blues
   adversity, [113]Alex Pietrangelo’s weeks-long absence with a knee
   injury, seems pretty minor in the context of this decades-long
   struggle.

   “You have years like this ... we’ve got one, we’ve been able to keep
   this thing going taking a lot of body blows,” Hitchcock said after
   Monday’s practice. “It’s like ‘OK, damage done, now let’s move
   forward.’ Nobody in here is overwhelmed by what’s going on. We’ve had
   to win games missing seven, eight guys. So this is something that we’ve
   been used to all year. We’ve been able to move forward emotionally,
   mentally, physically, everything.”

   Fifty years on, the Blues are still battling, still striving to take
   that final step.

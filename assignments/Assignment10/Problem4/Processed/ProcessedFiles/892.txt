Episode Description

   The buzz: Finally…Social Selling has grabbed business headlines since
   at least 2012, with companies worldwide hanging onto every word of
   advice from a handful of Social Selling gurus. It’s time to peek behind
   the curtain and find out if Social Selling is a proven cure-all for
   old-school, impersonal, annoying cold-calling, and if its best
   practices are set in stone or still evolving. We’re asking three
   thought leaders to tell us once and for all if Social Selling is
   fantasy and hype or fix and hope. The experts speak. Kurt Shaver, The
   Sales Foundry: “The first thing you should do as a Social Seller is
   enhance your LinkedIn profile… create a good impression before jumping
   in.” Jim Fields, SAP: “The term ‘Social Selling’ is actually a bad name
   for what we are talking about.” Kirsten Boileau, SAP: “Sales can’t do
   Social Selling without Marketing, and Marketing can’t do Social Selling
   without Sales." Join us for Social Selling: Fantasy or Fix, Hype or
   Hope? Three Experts Speak.

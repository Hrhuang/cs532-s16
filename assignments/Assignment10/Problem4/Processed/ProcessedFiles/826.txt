supporting games

   Amazon is getting into the games engine business with a
   free-to-download 3D engine called Lumberyard.

   Lumberyard can be used to develop for PC and consoles, Amazon [106]said
   in a news release. It's rolling out alongside a multiplayer service
   called GameLift.

   Lumberyard is entirely free, Amazon says, including no requirement to
   share revenue. Amazon will make money off Amazon Web Services that
   developers use to build or support their games. GameLift has a $1.50
   per 1,000 daily active user fee, in addition to standard fees for any
   other Amazon Web Services used.

   Lumberyard is currently in beta. GameLift servers are on in two U.S.
   regions, Oregon and Northern Virginia, with more regions coming online
   soon.

   Amazon is touting GameLift as a convenient means of including and
   deploying multiplayer features, noting that costs to support such
   components are often out of range for smaller developers. "With Amazon
   GameLift and Amazon Lumberyard, developers can create multiplayer
   back-ends with less effort, technical risk, and time delays that often
   cause developers to cut multiplayer features from their games," the
   company said in a statement.

   Lumberyard also will be integrated with Twitch so that developers can
   take advantage of streaming features and a wide audiences they attract
   through that network. One such tool in Lumberyard, Twitch ChatPlay,
   allows developers to add a feature that allows viewers to use Twitch's
   chat to control the game, similar to the "Twitch Plays" craze that hit
   in early 2014.

   Lumberyard also includes a Twitch JoinIn feature that allows
   broadcasters to invite audience members into their games, either
   cooperatively or competitively.

   While other engines such as [107]Unity 5 or [108]Unreal Engine 4 are
   free to use, they have royalties or licensing fees if the project
   launches. [109]Gamasutra has a long interview with Lumberyard's general
   manager, Eric Schenk, on the origins of this venture and Amazon's
   vision for it.

   Get ready for "the definitive jeans brand of the 21st century."

   It was announced today, via a [19]press release from G-Star RAW and on
   [20]Pharrell Williamsʼs Instagram account, that the music
   mega-producer, The Voice judge, Billionaire Boys Club and Ice Cream
   owner, childrenʼs book author, Adidas sneaker designer, movie producer,
   and philanthropist (are we leaving anything out?) entered into a
   "strategic partnership" with the Dutch denim brand.

   Financial rewards (and risks) aside, Williams will be "immersed in the
   company on many creative levels, from collections, to advertising and
   business strategy." And while that general outline doesnʼt dictate just
   how involved heʼll be in the design process of each collection, itʼs
   safe to assume that this new arrangement will build on [22]Williamsʼs
   previous endeavors with G-Star, most notably his Bionic Yarn recycled
   denim program. But for the hyperbole-happy Pharrell, the partnership
   represents more than just a savvy business move or the chance to weigh
   in on denimʼs newest trends—it offers him the chance to build, what he
   believes, "will be the definitive jeans brand of the 21st century."
   After all, Williams does wear a lot jeans (like, more than most
   boldface names we can think of), so maybe that promise is more than
   just a positive pull quote.

   Chaos was unleashed on the streets of quaint English villages today as
   thousands gathered to watch one of the nation's oldest and bloodiest
   sporting traditions.

   The Royal Shrovetide Football match is an adrenaline-fueled tradition
   with roots going back to at least the 12th century - and the game has
   barely moved on since then.

   And further north, scores of competitors battled it out in a similar
   tradition in Sedgefield, County Durham.

   There are very few rules in existence, and despite the apparent
   violence, 'murder and manslaughter is prohibited' is the main one.

   And although there are no rules dictating how brutal tackles can be,
   the rules do state that 'unnecessary violence is frowned upon'.

   The action had earlier kicked off with the 'turning-up' of the ball at
   Shawcroft car park where well over 2,000 people had gathered for the
   unusual Pancake Day spectacle.

   The painted ball was lofted into the crowd slightly later than the
   scheduled 2pm start, sending unprepared on-lookers scattering for cover
   as the serious players grappled for the prize.

   Play then spilled out through the yard of a local butcher's shop and
   into the main street.

   Lorries and even a local school bus, trapped by the road closures,
   became the centre of the frenetic action as the ball rolled underneath
   the vehicles.

   At one point, Up'Ard players tried to smuggle the ball along the chilly
   waters of the brook but were turned back.

   Steam started to rise off both sets of teams as the tide of play ebbed
   and flowed across the streets, with players using road signs and shop
   barricades to gain any advantage and free the ball from their
   opponents' grasp.

   However, a late break saw the Up'Ards dash across the town's bridge
   where they were halted near the No. 108 bus service from Leek, much to
   the bemusement of its passengers.

   Then as the sun began to set, the Up'Ards' runners made a break with
   ball in hand to land the winning goal.

   The game which 'tries the pluck of an Englishman' ended in a goal after
   a gruelling contest involving hundreds of players.

   At just after 5pm, one of their number struck the ball three times, as
   the ancient rules dictate, at Sturston goal on the east side of
   Ashbourne.

   Anyone who 'goals' the ball - by tapping it three times on their team's
   millstone - gets to keep it, and is traditionally carried shoulder-high
   into the Green Man pub.

   Veteran player 54-year-old Roy Murfin, preparing for the day's action
   with a pint at the George and Dragon, said he had first seen the match
   aged six.

   The Ashbourne resident said his worst injuries were 'sprained ankles
   and cracked ribs' but that the action was always 'in good humour'.

   Asked how the players cope with the relentless action, he said: 'You
   have to keep coming out and others go in, because you get so hot.'

   'If you do get pulled down, then they usually pick you back up. One
   year we had a fella who kept falling down, and we would pick him up. We
   lifted him up, and his artificial leg fell off.'

   He added: 'By and large, it's pretty good natured.'

   The action will begin again tomorrow, which is traditionally a more
   local affair with less outside visitors joining in the action.

   On Wednesday, the ball will be 'turned-up' by D-Day veteran Bill
   Milward of Ashbourne on what will be his 100th birthday.

   He will join the likes of the Prince of Wales and Sir Stanley Matthews,
   who have also shared the honour.

   Shops board up their windows for protection and paramedics are on
   standby for the inevitable sprained ankles.

   The game earned the royal moniker after the prince of Wales, later king
   Edward VIII, 'turned-up' in 1928.

   In Sedgefield, County Durham, it has been taking place for 900 years
   and scores of people turn up every Shrove Tuesday to take part.

   It isn't just the crowds that are smaller than they are in the
   Ashbourne game. The ball is is the size of a cricket ball as opposed to
   the much larger one used further south.

   Today, the game started at 1pm, when the four-inch diameter leather
   ball was passed through a metal ring on the village green.

   The players then kicked the ball through the village to the streams
   where it must be placed three times then back through the ring before
   sundown.

   The free-for all battle attracted scores of onlookers who enjoyed the
   chaotic spectacle, with violent tussles from the competitors.

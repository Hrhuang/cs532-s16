Announcing The Division Open Beta

   02/09/2016 09:00 AM

   The Division is throwing its doors wide open next week with an open
   beta that will let everyone explore its devastated New York ahead of
   the game's launch. Whether you're a veteran of the closed beta or this
   is your first time stepping into an Agent's shoes, you'll be able to
   jump into the open beta from February 19-21 on PS4, PC and Xbox One.
   Also, Xbox One players can get started a day early with exclusive
   24-hour early access beginning on February 18, but players on all
   platforms can preload the beta starting February 16.

   The development team has closed many of the PC cheating vunerabilities
   discovered during the closed beta, and has resolutions identified for
   the remaining PC cheating issues, which will be included in time for
   launch on March 8. The developers will also closely monitor the open
   beta for any new issues, and address them accordingly.

   If this isn't your first time playing The Division, there are extra
   incentives to come back, starting with a new story mission that wasn't
   in the closed beta. Also, everyone who participates in the open beta
   gets access to a special in-game reward that will be unlocked when the
   full game is released for Xbox One, PS4, and PC on March 8.

   Want to know what you'll be up against before then? From Rikers Island
   escapees and roving Rioters to the flamethrower-equipped Cleaners and
   the highly-trained Last Man Battalion, there's no shortage of factions
   looking to take control of the city on their own terms. Be sure to
   check out the new trailer (above) to see what these groups are all
   about.

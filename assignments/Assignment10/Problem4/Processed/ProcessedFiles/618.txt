E-sports and gambling convergence set to ignite business boom

Canada among hotbeds of rapidly growing e-sports business that’s emerging
from dorms and basement suites into the mainstream marketplace

   Feb. 9, 2016, 8 a.m.

   There it is, in bold white letters on a black bar, over the top of the
   shocking-pink Leet.gg website: “Kill your friends and take their
   money.”

   Don’t call 911. Call your investment manager.

   The cheeky slogan is on a website that takes Bitcoin payment for
   multi-player, cash-prize tournaments for video games like
   Counter-Strike, League of Legends and Minecraft. Last August, Eilers
   Research published its eSports Betting: It’s Real, and Bigger Than You
   Think white paper that projected US$250 million in gambling on
   competitive video gaming in 2015, ballooning to US$23 billion by 2020.

   “E-sports and gambling are converging,” University of California, Los
   Angeles gambling studies Prof. Brett Abarbanel told the BC Lottery
   Corp.’s (BCLC) New Horizons in Responsible Gambling Conference on
   February 2.

   “These industries are meeting, and they’re absolutely exploding. We
   have multiple gambling variants, we have multiple gaming variants. We
   have combinations of crossovers: the gaming components are in the
   gambling games, the gambling components are in the gaming games.”

   Eilers concluded that “e-sports is an extremely hospitable environment
   [technologically, logistically, culturally and demographically] for
   real-money online wagering.”

   Betting by the gamer community and growth of betting on e-sports “is
   beginning to benefit from tailwinds generated by positive macro trends
   for both e-sports and the broader online gambling industry.”

   Indeed, the bandwagon is filling up, as video game players emerge from
   basements to become stars online, at stadium stages and on traditional
   broadcast networks.

   In January, Activision Blizzard (Nasdaq:ATVI) bought Major League
   Gaming for US$46 million.

   The company’s senior vice-president, Mike Sepso, told Wired that the
   mandate was to “build the ESPN of e-sports.”

   ESPN added e-sports news and scores to its website last year. Seattle
   e-sports startup Unikrn has attracted investment from the Dallas
   Mavericks’ billionaire owner Mark Cuban and actor Ashton Kutcher.

   Abarbanel said e-sports bears all the hallmarks of traditional major
   sports leagues, with ticket sales, event organization, commentary,
   merchandising and media sales.

   “The core of it is all about entertainment generated by spectating a
   competition.”

   It is biggest in the United States and China, but South Korea and
   Canada are also hotbeds. E-sports gambling is in a grey area, an
   unregulated product that is a game of skill, yet some of the players on
   which wagers are placed are only “tweens.”

   The top players in the sport are gaining profile. Vancouver 22-year-old
   Kurtis “Aui_2000” Ling helped the Evil Geniuses team win the $6.6
   million International Dota 2 Championships last summer in Seattle.

   Evil Geniuses also are the odds-on favourite at the February 24 Dota 2
   Shanghai Major, according to BCLC’s e-sports page on PlayNow.com. The
   Crown corporation reported $109.1 million in e-gaming revenue in
   2014-15, but did not break down the segments.

   “These professional teams will live together in one house, and they
   won’t do anything except eat, sleep and practise,” Abarbanel said.

   “They are actively training much in the same way that a traditional
   athlete has to train his muscle memory.”

   Not surprisingly, they use special equipment to improve their posture
   and circulation, because the sport requires such intense concentration
   and sitting for long periods. In a data-driven atmosphere, players are
   rated by efficient actions per minute. It’s not just how fast they can
   click, she said, “but how fast you can click usefully.”

   Abarbanel added that the sport is also facing growing pains that range
   from allegations of performance-enhancing drug use to match fixing.
   There is no single global governing organization for e-sports, and the
   gambling component leaves it open to potential addiction.

   E-sports will be coming to a theatre near you. Cineplex (TSX:CGX)
   announced the US$10 million purchase of WorldGaming last September and
   said it planned to invest US$5 million to create a competitive gaming
   league. That came on the heels of last August’s live showing of the ESL
   One Cologne 2015 Counter-Strike: GO Tournament.

   E-sports is exploding among millennials who are entering campus
   tournaments. University of British Columbia and Simon Fraser University
   teams went head-to-head in January on a tournament that was webcast
   live by Twitch.tv, the Amazon-owned website that shows matches around
   the clock and allows participants to trash-talk each other in real
   time.  •

Chocolate Champs No Bake Cookies

   [33]Big Game Chocolate Champs 2_1

   Hi, it’s Still Blonde’s resident baker, Alexzandra! I’m back with a
   wonderful treat for you. Chocolate Champs No Bake Cookies are a Big
   Game Party treat that’s hard to beat! Quick to make— no-bake! Easy to
   take-n’-go. Add some flair to your super-bowl party with this easy
   recipe that will make peanut butter and chocolate lovers craving to
   know how they are made.

A Family Favorite for Years!

   My family has made this recipe for YEARS. My siblings and I talk all
   the time about when we were in elementary all the other students would
   grab these cookies first at school parties, because Chocolate Champs No
   Bake Cookies taste SO GOOD. No one else ever brought in a better treat
   for school events. My dad always helped us make these, with his
   contribution being to make sure all the ingredients were there because
   these cookies are SO EASY to make.

   easy recipe that will make peanut butter and chocolate lovers craving

   Author: Alexzandra O'Donnell
   Recipe type: Cookie
   Serves: 10
   Ingredients
     * 7 oz box of original Ritz Crackers
     * 16 oz jar of smooth Peanut Butter ( I used Jiff)
     * Two 12 oz packages of Hersey’s Milk Chocolate Chips
     * ½ cup of Crisco (shortening)
     * Optional: Decorative toppers or writing frosting
     * [35]Big Game Chocolate Champs ingredients

   Instructions
    1. Cover a cooking pan with aluminum foil, preferably a shallow cookie
       sheet.
    2. Frost a Ritz cracker evenly with peanut butter. Add another Ritz
       cracker on top to “sandwich” the peanut butter in-between
    3. Prepare the whole box of Ritz this way. You may use several pans.
       When a pan is completed, place in the fridge to cool
    4. Pour 2 packages of chocolate chips into a microwave safe bowl. Melt
       in microwave for 30 seconds, take out, and mix. Continue in 30
       second increments until completely melted.
    5. [36]Big Game Chocolate Champs preparation
    6. Remove a tray of the prepared Ritz and peanut butter sandwiches
       from the fridge. Dip each sandwich one-by-one into your bowl of
       chocolate, completely covering the sandwich. Place back on tray to
       cool.
    7. [37]Big Game Chocolate Champs preparation 2_1
    8. If placing decorative toppers onto cookies, place when chocolate is
       still slightly melted. This will make sure they stay in place. If
       writing on cookies, wait until they are chilled to avoid smearing.
    9. Put tray back into fridge to chill.
   10. Once chilled, cookies are ready to eat! When the cookies are
       chilled, they are simple to pop into a to-go container or onto a
       serving tray.

   This is a great recipe to make for any event, and a nice way to bring
   the whole family together through baking. As you can imagine, you can
   vary the chocolate (white, fancy colors), the insides of the sandwich,
   and the toppings. Let your imagination run wild.

Pin the Big Game Chocolate Champs for Later.  Enjoy the Game.

       I think these big game chocolate champs no bake cookies would be

       Very cute idea and I bet it tastes great, too! I love the football
       decorations; so unique and fitting. You could easily change up the
       decorations for different holidays. You could even use white
       chocolate chips and food coloring to get your teams colors. It’s
       basketball season and the round shape would be great for making
       them basketballs.

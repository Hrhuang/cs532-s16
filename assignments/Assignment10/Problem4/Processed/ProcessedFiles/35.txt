Christmas Tree Game for Toddlers & Preschoolers

   December 13, 2013 by [86]Crystal McClean

   Our Christmas Tree Game for toddlers and preschoolers is a fun and
   fast-paced learning game.  Weâ€™ve used it for helping our children learn
   their shapes and colours.  It can also be adapted for primary aged kids
   for other subjects.  This post contains affiliate links for your
   convenience.

   What supplies will you need for the Christmas Tree Game?
     * Green construction paper or[88] card stock
     * scrap bits of paper in various colours
     * scissors and/or [89]craft punches
     * laminator or clear [90]sticky-backed plastic

How to assemble the Christmas Tree Game.

   I cut out the shape of a Christmas tree from a piece of green
   construction paper and laminated it.

   The first year Tristan and I played this he was learning about colours
   and shapes.  I cut out many shapes from various colours of paper.  some
   I cut free-hand and others I used a paper punch for.  I laminated and
   cut out the little shape decorations.

   I used some fun-tak to hold the trees up on the window (thus they
   double as window decorations when not in use).  However, I wouldnâ€™t
   advise having them on a window for the game itself.  We have a small
   home so Iâ€™ve used the window as a demonstration as our hall is too
   small to take photos in (and in case of an accident during the photos
   our glass is toughened to industry standard for childminding).

   There was a little bit of fun-tak on the back of each shape
   decoratoion.  We put them on the back on our [92]10 Little Snowman
   Cards and placed them across the room from the trees.

How we play the Christmas Tree Game.

   nurseries, Christmas games for childminders, photo

   The kids stood behind the cards on the floor and I called out a shape
   or a colour and they raced to pick up the correct item from their card
   and ran to put it on their tree.

   The first one to get their item on the tree won that round.  Or you can
   mix up the decorations and play until one player has an empty card.

   This game will grow with your children as you can write numbers,
   letters, or words on the decorations.  And when theyâ€™re a bit older
   yet, they could pick up the answer to math questions: 19-4 (6) for
   example.

   If you have only one child, you can race against them yourself or use a
   timer to see how full they can make the tree before their time is up.

   If youâ€™re looking to sneak in a little Christmas learning fun, we also
   have these ideas:

       That is so creative and affordable. The kids look like they are
       having a blast!

            They really enjoyed it last year. Iâ€™ll be getting it out again

       I think we are going to try this with felt. I have lots of that and
       no ideas for things to make with it right now. ðŸ™‚ This is great!!!

       I love these types of games. The holidays just arenâ€™t the same
       without some fun for the toddlers!

            Christmas just isnâ€™t the same without excited little faces and
            voices!

       [131]December 14, 2013 at 9:25 pm
       This is such a good idea! Unfortunately, with my older boys any
       competition turns into a reason for the to beat on each other ðŸ˜‰

            [133]December 17, 2013 at 11:07 pm
            It sounds like you have a active house! Instead of having them
            compete against each other, you could set the timer and have
            them each aim for a personal best ðŸ˜‰ Or supply them both with
            soft bats (just kidding, of course!)

       Excellent, I must remember this.

            Thank you, Itâ€™s versatile, you can use it as a camping theme
            in the summer, or change the type of tree for Easter or
            Halloween, too.

   [37]Body Matters

These amazing, diverse models will be in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit
Issue

   [38]Sammy Nickalls / February 9, 2016 11:12 am

   [39]This time last year, we were thrilled about the #CurvesInBikinis
   movement, which led to the very first plus-sized model — Ashley Graham
   — to be featured in a Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue. Started by
   swimsuitsforall, #CurvesInBikinis encouraged women of all body types to
   feel beautiful just the way they are in any swimsuit.

   Now, SwimsuitsForAll is at it again with their new groundbreaking
   campaign, #SwimSexy. The campaign, which features three
   “curvilicious women,” will again appear in the SI Swimsuit Issue, but
   this time, the campaign is taking it a step further. Featuring
   Graham, British Ghanaian model Philomena Kwao, and 56-year-old model
   Nicola Griffin (the oldest woman to appear on the pages of the Swimsuit
   Issue), #SwimSexy embraces body diversity for women of any shape, size,
   age, or ethnicity. HelloGiggles had the chance to chat with Graham,
   Kwao, and Griffin about their participation in the campaign and what
   body positivity means to them.

   Graham, who was discovered as a model at age 12, is no stranger to
   trailblazing in the modeling industry. She did, after all, coin the
   term “body activist.” “Last year’s campaign broke barriers within the
   fashion industry and successfully empowered women to feel sexy at any
   size,” Graham, pictured below, told us. “I was thrilled to be asked to
   be in the #SwimSexy campaign this year to keep the momentum going. It
   is my personal mission to help women embrace their curves and boost
   confidence, and SwimsuitsForAll does this with elegance.”

   The shoot itself was an “incredible experience,” Kwao, pictured below,
   explained. “We shot on an island in Puerto Rico, with beautiful white
   sands and turquoise blue waters surrounding us,” she said. “Being in
   such a stunning environment calmed any nerves I had during the shoot.
   The team was also incredible. Everyone on set was so friendly and
   relaxed that it made the entire shoot feel like a holiday.”

   Kwao, whose family is from Ghana though she was born and raised in
   London, described the campaign as “revolutionary”:

     “For so long, there’s been a false idea that the only bodies that
     are beach-worthy are the ones that appear in magazines. The Sports
     Illustrated Swimsuit Issue is a cultural phenomenon and sets the
     standard for swimsuit modeling each year. By publishing this
     campaign in its biggest issue of the year, Sports Illustrated is
     demolishing those traditional standards of swimsuit modeling and
     shows that everybody is beach-worthy. How could I not be part of
     such a phenomenal movement?”

   Griffin, who just started modeling three years ago when she was 53, is
   also “thrilled” to be featured in the campaign. “Wearing a bikini,
   too!” Griffin, pictured below, told HG. “And why ever not — I’m sexy,
   I’m healthy, and I feel it’s about time we celebrated women all sizes
   and shapes and ages. . . I want to help motivate women to have the
   confidence to wear a bikini if they wish, and to show off their bodies
   and be accepted in our society.”

   “We are beautiful, no matter what size and whatever age we are,”
   Griffin, a mother of twin daughters, told HG. “. . . It’s been the most
   exciting thing to happen to me and I’m honored to be part of it. It was
   great fun to go on the shoot in a beautiful part of the world with some
   amazing people. I made some lovely friends.”

   But even though they were busy having fun, the models knew that what
   they were doing was groundbreaking. “The whole time we knew we were on
   the cusp of something big,” Graham said.

   Plus-size has come to the forefront of the fashion conversation as of
   late, and major retailers have been stepping up. Take Forever21, for
   example, which [40]recently came out with their new plus-size fashion
   line (starring Graham!). “I think that 2015 was a pivotal year for
   fashion brands and retailers accepting that women come in different
   shapes and sizes,” Graham explained. “There have been many retailers
   who have transformed their ‘plus size’ offerings into trendy, fashion
   forward collections. We always encourage flaunting our curves, not
   hiding them.”

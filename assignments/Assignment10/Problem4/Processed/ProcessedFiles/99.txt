An AI-powered Super Mario and Luigi can now learn from each other to beat
their own game – Quartz

   The machines are starting to team up—although for now, it’s just to
   beat classic video games.
   [INS: :INS]

   Researchers at the University of Tubingen in Germany [19]released a
   video Feb. 1 showing a version of the Nintendo game Super Mario World,
   in which an AI-powered Mario, Peach, Yoshi, Toad. Luigi (who just looks
   like a nauseous green Mario) can converse with each other. Work
   together to beat levels in the game, without any human interaction or
   prior knowledge of the level.

   ide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent

   The characters’ “brains” are controlled (much like many humans’) by
   four motivating desires: wealth, progress, curiosity. Health. This
   means they work through each level trying at various times to collect
   coins and power-ups, driven by the desire engine. As the video
   suggests, if Mario is being driven by a “strong desire for wealth,”
   he’ll reason out how to get more coins, figuring that if he smashes
   question blocks, he’ll likely get more coins. Mario then learns when
   his past experiences don’t match what happens: For example, if he’s
   after coins and smashes a block that gives him a star instead of a
   coin, he’ll learn that smashing blocks mightn't always get him more
   coins. When he’s fulfilled a desire, his desire engine will fire up
   another motivation.

   At any given point, a human can ask Mario through a microphone what
   he’s up to. Ask him to do something else. When the other characters are
   in play, they can talk to each other and learn about their different
   abilities. For instance, Toad can watch Mario crush a block with his
   head and learn that it’s possible to crush them. Then find out that
   he’s not able to break them with his soft mushroom head. The characters
   can work together, asking each other to use their differing abilities
   to help the group complete a level together.

   Beating games is a form of applied AI research that helps show that, in
   the future, AI could be used to solve general problems, rather than
   specific tasks. Researchers at Google DeepMind built a system last year
   that could beat many classic [21]Atari video games. Last month, it
   announced one of its AI programs had [22]managed to beat Go, a game
   many thought would take decades to crack. The research at Tubingen,
   which the group calls “Social Mario,” builds on work the team released
   [23]last year, where Mario could learn to beat levels on his own. Much
   like with humans, it’s a lot easier to solve problems when a few more
   brains are working on them.

   The researchers built the system to show how AI systems could operate
   in a social capacity with humans, according [24]to Gizmag. “Any type of
   intelligent support system would benefit from such social
   capabilities,” Fabian Schrodt, one of the developers on the project,
   told Gizmag.

   But considering the Mario they’ve created is so matter-of-fact about
   the way it thinks about [25]killing its enemies (“If I jump on Goomba,
   then it certainly dies”), it’s worrying to consider how an AI system
   like this might interact with humans. Hopefully the researchers haven’t
   shown future AI robots how to work together to overthrow humanity.

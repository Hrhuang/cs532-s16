   What you’re looking at is an architectural rendering of TCF Bank
   Stadium for the upcoming outdoor game between the Minnesota Wild and
   Chicago Blackhawks on Sunday, Feb. 21.

   The current forecast for that day in Minneapolis is a high of 27° F and
   a low of 19° F, with only a 20 percent possibility of precipitation,
   i.e. snow.

   Which is to say, that guy in the Toews jersey is gonna be cold. At
   least roll up your sleeves, man. Don’t be a hero.

   The game, scheduled for 3:30 p.m. ET, will be broadcast live on NBC as
   part of Hockey Day in America, while Hockey Night In Canada and TVA
   Sports will have the action for the folks up north.

   Perhaps it’s an ominous sign of bad luck to come, but for which team?

   Prior to puck drop between the host San Jose Sharks and Nashville
   Predators in Game 1 on Friday, a black cat hit the ice at SAP Center,
   taking a nervous stroll along the boards.

   Not sure exactly where it came from, although it’s possible someone was
   feeling extra superstitious before the start of this series.

   Official update on the really important story of the evening:

     Official word from the [105]#SJSharks is it was a loose cat in the
     building that was trying to evade capture. I think [106]@brguerrero
     finally got him

     In case you missed it — there was a cat on the ice here at SAP
     Center before warmups. [108]#SJSharks [109]#Preds

   The Dallas Stars scored a late winner, held on in the final minute and
   eventually struck first in their best-of-seven second-round series with
   the St. Louis Blues.

   Once again, it was the speed and skill of the Stars that proved to be
   the difference in the end. [124]Radek Faksa scored with less than five
   minutes remaining in the third period, breaking the deadlock and giving
   Dallas a 2-1 victory and 1-0 series lead over their Central Division
   foes on Friday.

   As he entered the zone on the rush, Faksa dished off to a flying
   [125]Ales Hemsky, who was denied by [126]Brian Elliott in alone. But
   Faksa followed up, jamming in the rebound to give the Stars the lead,
   as both St. Louis defensemen [127]Jay Bouwmeester and [128]Alex
   Pietrangelo were caught by the speed of the Dallas forwards on the
   rush.

   The Stars held on from there, as the Blues made a late push to tie the
   game.

   [130]Kari Lehtonen stopped 31 of 32 shots for Dallas, while Elliott was
   busy throughout the night, stopping 40 of 42 shots.

   Elliott was [131]furious after the Stars opened the scoring in the
   second period, as [132]Antoine Roussel tallied on a rebound after yet
   another nice Dallas passing play in the offensive zone.

   Stars forward [133]Patrick Eaves left the game early in the third
   period and didn’t play another shift after being hit in the lower part
   of his leg with the puck from a point shot.

     Patrick Eaves carried to locker room after being hit with a puck in
     front of net. Twice last year we saw him seriously injured the same
     way

   The Dallas Stars grabbed the all-important first goal in Game 1 against
   the St. Louis Blues on Friday. And it was agitating forward
   [155]Antoine Roussel who capitalized in the second period.

   Roussel buried a rebound at the end of a pretty passing play from the
   Stars. Blues goalie [156]Brian Elliott was furious, as defenseman
   [157]Jay Bouwmeester slid into the crease in an attempt to block the
   shot.

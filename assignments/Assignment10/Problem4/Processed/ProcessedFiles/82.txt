   [97]Jimmy Butler is [98]out of the NBA All-Star Game in Toronto this
   weekend due to a strained knee. Which sucks, because he earned that
   spot, and while the fans didn’t vote him in the coach’s did.

   Butler’s teammate [99]Pau Gasol will replace him.

   NBA Commissioner Adam Silver gets to make the call on a replacement,
   and he stayed in Chicago, but he added a front court player to replace
   a guard. Keeping a Bulls representative might have been part of the
   thinking. The coaches’ votes on replacement players has been weighed in
   the past (Gasol may have been high on that list, coaches love him).
   Also, the East roster has a lot of wings and was light on bigs
   ([100]Andre Drummond, [101]Paul Millsap and [102]Chris Bosh are the
   only real bigs), so this gives coach Tyronn Lue some flexibility up
   front.

   The East leading Cleveland Cavaliers remain with just one
   representative, [103]LeBron James (voted in by the fans).

   Gasol is averaging 17 points, 10.9 rebounds, and a couple blocks a
   game, and is the only thing close to a consistent performer the Bulls
   have. Besides the injured Butler.

   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) [122]Paul George scored 21 points, [123]Myles Turner
   added 15 and the Indiana Pacers beat the Toronto Raptors 101-83 on
   Friday night to force a Game 7 of their series.

   That will be played Sunday in Toronto, and the winner will advance to
   the Eastern Conference semifinals.

   Indiana scored 18 straight points in the second half to pull away from
   the second-seeded Raptors, who haven’t won a postseason series since
   the first round in 2001.

   [124]DeMarre Carroll and [125]Cory Joseph each had 15 points for the
   Raptors.

   [126]Kyle Lowry (4 for 14) and [127]DeMar DeRozan (3 for 13) struggled
   again, and now the Raptors will head home and hear again about their
   troubled playoff problems: a Game 7 loss at home to Brooklyn in 2014,
   Washington’s four-game sweep last season and no series wins in a
   seven-game series. And there 15-year victory drought is the longest
   active streak in the league.

   Indiana trailed by as much as 12 early, never led until early in the
   third quarter and had to fend off a late third-quarter charge from the
   Raptors before blowing it open in the fourth.

   After Toronto cut the deficit to 65-64, Indiana responded by scoring
   the last six points of the third and the first 12 of the fourth to take
   an 83-64 lead.

   The Raptors never recovered.

   For Indiana, it was a dramatic turnabout.

   Three days after blowing a 13-point, fourth-quarter lead, they came out
   flat. The Pacers struggled to make baskets, struggled to defend and
   played catch-up the entire first half after Toronto took an 18-6 lead
   just 6 1/2 minutes into the game.

   But once the Pacers got righted, they took control and pulled away.

   Indiana rebounded from a 44-40 halftime deficit with a 10-2 run to take
   its first lead, 49-48 on [128]Ian Mahinmi‘s tip-in with 9:33 left. They
   extended the lead to 63-55 before Toronto charged back to get within
   65-64 in the final two minutes of the quarter.

   Indiana scored the next 18 points to seal it.

   GOLDEN CROWD

   Indiana handed out gold T-shirts to fans at the game and it caused a
   bit of a stir because the wording on the shirts read: United State of
   Basketball, We The Gold. It was a twist on Toronto’s motto – We The
   North. Raptors coach Dwane Casey didn’t seem to mind that Indiana stole
   the idea. “I know that they have a great home court. You know you’re in
   Pacers territory because of all the gold shirts,” he said. “But what
   happens between the lines for 48 minutes is what I’m concerned about.”

   TIP-INS

   Raptors: The Raptors wound up getting outrebounded 44-40 after
   dominating the post in the first half. … [129]Jonas Valanciunas had 14
   points, Lowry had 10 and DeRozan finished with eight. … [130]Bismack
   Biyombo grabbed 10 rebounds. … Toronto gave up 20 points on 17
   turnovers. … The last time the Raptors led a series 3-2 was in 2014
   against Brooklyn. But the Nets won 97-83 on their home court before
   clinching the series with a 104-103 victory in Game 7 at Toronto.

   Pacers: Turner blocked four shots, giving him 19 in the series to break
   Antonio Davis’ previous franchise rookie record in a six-game series. …
   Indiana started the second half by making five of its first seven
   shots. … Actor-comedian Mike Epps, who lives in Indy, attended the
   game. … The Pacers have won four straight elimination games on their
   home court.

   “It’s a make-or-miss league” has been a worn-out cliche in the NBA for
   years, but it was never more apt than Friday night. [142]Dwyane Wade, a
   career 28.4 percent three-point shooter who hadn’t hit a shot from
   beyond the arc in the calendar year of 2016, knocked down two threes
   late to help the Miami Heat hold on and beat the Charlotte Hornets,
   97-90, to force a Game 7 on Sunday.

   Wade finished with 23 points on 10-for-20 shooting along with 6
   rebounds and 4 assists to lead Miami, and had a key block in the
   closing minute to stave off a Charlotte comeback. The Heat held off
   [143]Kemba Walker‘s 37-point explosion, which kept Charlotte in the
   game for much of the second half even as they never led in the third or
   fourth quarters.

   Neither team got much out of their benches, and Miami overcame a rough
   night from [144]Goran Dragic (6-for-17 from the field) and [145]Hassan
   Whiteside fouling out in just 28 minutes of action. A three by Walker
   cut Miami’s lead to 90-88, the closest the Hornets got in the second
   half.

   The two teams will now play a Game 7 in Miami on Sunday, with the
   winner facing the winner of that same day’s Game 7 between the Raptors
   and Pacers.

   Less than a week after firing head coach Byron Scott, the Lakers have
   their man to replace him: Luke Walton, who is currently associate head
   coach with the Warriors and coached the team to a 39-4 start to the
   season while Steve Kerr was out recovering from offseason back surgery.

   The Lakers announced the hiring of Walton in a press release on Friday
   evening:

     Earlier today, the Los Angeles Lakers and Luke Walton reached an
     agreement on a multi-year contract for Walton to become the next
     Head Coach of the team, it was announced by General Manager Mitch
     Kupchak. Walton will begin his new duties at the conclusion of the
     Golden State Warriors season.
     “We’re excited to bring Luke back to Los Angeles, where we feel he’s
     going to start an outstanding coaching career,” said Kupchak. “He’s
     one of the brightest young coaching minds in the game and we feel
     fortunate that he’ll be leading the on-court future of our team.”

   The Warriors released statements from Kerr and GM Bob Myers after the
   Lakers’ announcement:

     “We are thrilled for Luke,” said Warriors GM Bob Myers.  “This is a
     tremendous opportunity for him to return home and serve as head
     coach for one of the most storied franchises in sports.   Luke has
     done an incredible job during his two-year stint with our team and
     has played a significant role in our success, including last year’s
     championship and again this season under some very unique
     circumstances.  We are certainly going to miss Luke after we
     conclude our playoff run this season, but we wish him the very best
     with the Lakers.”

     “I’m incredibly happy for Luke,” said Warriors Head Coach Steve
     Kerr.  “As we witnessed earlier this season, he has all of the
     intangibles necessary to be an outstanding head coach in this
     league, including a terrific understanding of the game the ability
     to communicate with a wide range of people.   He’s certainly ready
     for this opportunity and I’m confident he’ll do a great job with the
     Lakers once our season is complete.”

   Walton had long been rumored to be the Lakers’ top target, given his
   successful run with the Warriors and his ties to the organization,
   where he played for nine seasons. It’s a solid hire, not a big name but
   someone with a good reputation around the league.

   Game 6 of the Raptors-Pacers series is in Indianapolis, but that didn’t
   stop a large crowd from gathering outside the Air Canada Centre to

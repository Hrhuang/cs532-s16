Firewatch is a mystery set in the Wyoming wilderness, where your only
emotional lifeline is the person on the other end of a handheld radio.

   The year is 1989.
   You are a man named Henry who has retreated from your messy life to
   work as a fire lookout in the Wyoming wilderness. Perched atop a
   mountain, it's your job to find smoke and keep the wilderness safe.
   An especially hot, dry summer has everyone on edge. Your supervisor, a
   woman named Delilah, is available to you

   at all times over a small, handheld radio—and is your only contact with
   the world you've left behind.
   But when something strange draws you out of your lookout tower and into
   the world below, you'll explore a wild and unknown environment, facing
   questions and making interpersonal choices that can build or destroy
   the only meaningful relationship you have.

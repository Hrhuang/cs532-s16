Predators' Colin Wilson could return against Capitals

   After missing 12 games to nurse a lower-body injury, Predators forward
   Colin Wilson has been removed from injured reserve and is expected
   to return Tuesday against the Capitals.

   "Yeah, I think that's the plan right now," Wilson said after fully
   practicing Monday.

   Lower-body injuries previously sidelined Wilson for five games in
   December, but he declined to specify Monday if his most recent ailment
   was related to his previous ones. The Predators canceled their morning
   skate Tuesday, but based on Monday's practice, Wilson could start on a
   line with forwards Mike Fisher and Craig Smith.

   Wilson's season has undoubtedly been disappointing. He scored a
   career-high 20 goals last season, but has not been able to overcome the
   inconsistency that has defined his NHL career. He has four goals this
   season, once enduring a 21-game goalless drought that spanned two
   months, and his 5.3 shooting percentage is well below his 12.3 career
   average.

   Predators' Mattias Ekholm thriving in increased role

   But in his last eight games prior to getting hurt, Wilson, who hasn't
   played since Jan. 8, had three goals and seven points, feeling like he
   had recaptured the power-forward form that has led him to success.

   “I liked the way I played before I got hurt,” Wilson said. “I think
   the bounces started coming. I think I was playing with a lot more
   confidence with the puck. I’m going to keep up that confidence. Even
   though I had that time off, I still felt good out there."

   [59]Earlier this season, Wilson may have let the pressure of heightened
   expectations consume him, negatively affecting his mindset and
   therefore his play. He attributed his strong pre-injury stretch to a
   more relaxed state of mind.

   "I think that's what happened (during) my last little run of games
   there before I got hurt," Wilson said. "I really just wasn't taking
   anything for granted and was trying to have fun out there and help the
   team win. When you have that mindset, goals start going in, you start
   getting points."

   Predators ready for test from NHL's best: The Capitals are the NHL's
   top team, entering Tuesday's game with a 38-9-4 record, which has them
   on pace for the best season in their four-decade history. They are also
   the league's best offensive team, sporting a plus-54 goal differential
   and averaging 3.25 goals per game.

   Washington, led by former Predators coach Barry Trotz is the only team
   that Nashville hasn't faced this season.

   Predators week ahead: Sunshine State awaits

   "They're a really good team," Predators coach Peter Laviolette said.
   "We're going to have to be sharp. They've got good balance on their
   lines, good defense, good goaltending. They're big and they can skate,
   so they bring a lot to the table. We'll need to be sharp (Tuesday)."

   Ribeiro to be honored: Predators center Mike Ribeiro played his 1,000th
   NHL game Saturday against the Sharks, but will be formally honored for
   the achievement prior to Tuesday's game against the Capitals,
   coincidentally one of his former teams.

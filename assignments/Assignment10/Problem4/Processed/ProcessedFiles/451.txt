   Keith Olbermann joined [43]Jonah Keriâ€™s Nerdist podcast for a two-part
   marathon late last week. Around the 1:19:00-mark of Part I, they began
   talking about contemporary sports media, and Olbermann, who as weâ€™re
   all aware made his bones as a SportsCenter anchor alongside Dan Patrick
   in the 1990â€™s, spelled out doom and gloom for the future of the
   franchise:

     If youâ€™re doing a sports broadcast that has to do with more than one
     sport at a time? Good-bye. There is no reason anymore for a consumer
     to watch SportsCenter, or the Fox version of SportsCenter, or the
     Canadian version of SportsCenter, or the Rogers Canadian version of
     SportsCenter, or SportsCenter in Spanish, or your local â€” I grew up
     watching Marv Albert do the local sports news on Channel 4 â€” and
     thereâ€™s no reason to watch that, because if theyâ€™re talking about
     football, and you hate football, ESPN supplies you with something at
     your fingertips about baseball, soccer, hockey, badminton, jai alai.

     By the way, thereâ€™s a jai alai channel. Thereâ€™s a horse racing
     channel. Thereâ€™s a dog racing channel. Eventually, there will be no
     market for these other multi-purpose shows, and you think about
     this, and say, â€˜Oh itâ€™s a new phenomenon, weâ€™ve got some time to
     go.â€™ No, itâ€™s the dark hours now. Just name to me, whatâ€™s the most
     recent, multi-sport, not connected to the NFL, not connected to game
     broadcast, whatâ€™s the last breakthrough TV sports show?

   Olbermann reckoned this to be Pardon the Interruption, which went on
   the air in 2001, and said that because of this prolonged stretch that
   there have not been many young talents who have differentiated
   themselves as big stars. He also said that when they point to First
   Take as a beacon of success (and qualified that he likes both Skip
   Bayless and Stephen A. Smith), that their record viewership had metrics
   akin to typical hourly numbers for the [44]Hallmark Movies and Mystery
   channel, whatever that is. He acknowledged that his own most recent
   show never gained solid footing, and that live sports are still
   experiencing profound growth. He said that one-sport specialists will
   over take the generalists.

   It does seem unlikely, in this era of media segmentation, that anybody
   will once again capture the relevance that SportsCenter had in the
   1990â€™s when it was basically the only way youâ€™d catch the highlights,
   and the personalities were larger than life. However, I donâ€™t quite
   share Olbermannâ€™s broader pessimism. Somewhere, somehow, the right
   talent and producers will come together and make general sports
   programming where viewership is essential, and therefore massive.

   Maybe this will come from a well capitalized television network, or
   maybe it will just be people who create something incredible on their
   phones and initially gain a big following on Facebook or Snapchat. The
   barriers to entry are so low, and the platforms so diverse, that itâ€™s
   only a matter of time before we realize that something else is the next
   SportsCenter or PTI. So, perhaps Olbermannâ€™s right that cable sports
   television is on an inexorable downward slope, but if entities like Fox
   and ESPN are smart about integrating and co-opting the digital
   landscape, theyâ€™ll persevere.

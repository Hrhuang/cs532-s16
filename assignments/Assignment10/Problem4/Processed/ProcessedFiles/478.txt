First details on SeaFall, the next game from co-designer of Pandemic: Legacy

A preview of Rob Daviau's biggest, most ambitious board game yet

   Three years ago tabletop game designer Rob Daviau left his job at
   Hasbro, one of the world's largest board game publishers, and struck
   out on his own. Since then he's worked on several successful titles,
   but none have received more critical acclaim than the games in his
   Legacy series. His most recent title, Pandemic: Legacy, was released in
   October and quickly rose up the ranks at the community site Board Game
   Geek to become the top-rated board game [105]of all time.

   Now Daviau is ready to reveal details of his next project, called
   SeaFall: A Legacy Game, which he says will be bigger and more ambitious
   than anything he's done before.

   "It took me less time to get my bachelor’s degree than it did to make
   this game," Daviau told Polygon, "and I took summers off for that. It’s
   a big game, and it got away from me for a while.

   "When I left Hasbro I said to myself, 'I’m going to make the biggest
   game I can.' And then all of a sudden it was a mess. So it was 95
   percent done for two years, and I could not figure out how to wrestle
   it down. So I just stuck to it. Good old-fashioned New England
   stubbornness, I guess."

   Legacy games evolve over multiple play sessions. The game board itself
   changes, reflecting the history of the world players create together at
   the table. Characters and factions gain new abilities, and new rules
   are added while a narrative unfolds.

   "The first Legacy game, [107]Risk: Legacy, is actually a mashup of
   episodic television, role-playing and video games," Daviau said. By
   borrowing from these other genres, he was able to subvert his biggest
   pet peeve about board games — their complicated rulesets.

   "I always hate in board games that in order to start game one you have
   to digest an entire rulebook. You can’t sip it ... It’s this great
   struggle that we always have as game designers, which is I want to give
   you this rich system, but I don’t want you to sit there and get 15
   minutes into the rules and say ‘I’m out! I can’t even understand this!
   I just want to get started!’ So, the whole idea of locking away content
   and then spoon-feeding it one rule at a time was entirely based on how
   video games introduced just-in-time concepts for either story, or
   rules, or both."

   But where Risk: Legacy and Pandemic: Legacy were written to resemble
   summer action-thrillers in their pacing, Daviau said SeaFall more
   closely resembles the size and scale of the epic Lord of the Rings
   trilogy.

   It begins in a world which, while not our own, most closely resembles
   the swashbuckling period of the 16th century. Players take on the role
   of one of several provinces, journeying out into the oceans aboard
   heavily armed capital ships for the first time after a long dark age —
   not unlike after the fall of the Roman Empire.

   Players will start at various points on a long coastline at the Eastern
   edge of the gameboard, which will be fashioned to look like an old
   nautical map. As they explore to the West with their flagships (each
   province will have two), players will reveal new islands — and other
   surprises — which they'll place on the board in the form of small
   stickers to mark their location. At the top and bottom of the board
   players will place larger stickers representing big inset maps for each
   place that they discover.

   The meat of the game will be in exploring these places, "like Indiana
   Jones but in the 16th century," Daviau said.

   Bundled with each copy of the game will be the Captains' Booke, a kind
   of choose your own adventure journal. Whenever players trigger certain
   in-game events — called Milestones — they'll read large sections of
   this book that will move the game's narrative forward. But the book
   will also be used for exploring individual locations on the map.

   "It has 430 entries," Daviau said. "I had to write it in sort of 16th
   century English — not with the language itself, but with the turns of
   phrase.

   ""When I left Hasbro I said to myself, 'I’m going to make the biggest
   game I can.'""

   "Let me make one up: You go to explore an island. At the front of the
   book is a generic map of an island, and it's got all these different
   places on it with numbers. So you go to an island, and you choose a
   location to explore. And you cross it out, and it says 'turn to Entry
   41.'"

   "M'lord," Daviau said, affecting his best period accent. "We pulled up
   upon the shore and spied in the hills what we thought to be gold.
   However, it turned out to be an ambush from some of the natives who
   knew that we were searching for gold in the area. We lost many of our
   crew, and my only question now is whether I go out to seek revenge or
   wait for another day since I’m down by many of my crew."

   If you retreat from the island, perhaps the natives take pity on you
   and help patch up your crew. That interaction could open up
   opportunities for trade later on. But if you elect to seek your
   revenge, there will be consequences. You'll recover treasure, but your
   ship will be damaged on its way into the shallows or more of your crew
   will be killed. You'll also have to place a number of Enmity tokens on
   the board, which will have negative consequences the next time you
   visit.

   Each player has eight Enmity tokens, and whenever they attack another
   province or another non-player faction they must spend Enmity to do it.
   Enmity has multiple effects in SeaFall, but its defining characteristic
   is how it forces players to to be careful about who they attack and
   when.

   "You can’t just declare war infinitely," Daviau said, "because when
   your eight tokens run out, you’re done. It’s basically saying no,
   you’ve reached your jerk limit. If Enmity isn't removed at the end of a
   round, it becomes permanent. So I could look at a map of SeaFall when
   you're done playing and I will see certain islands and certain events
   and certain things in certain places. I can look at the Enmity on the
   board and I could probably recount your world’s history pretty well
   from just looking at that map. You’re going to be building a map that
   is also an historical artifact."

   While it's hard to really put into words given the secrecy surrounding
   the contents of the game, Daviau says that SeaFall will have about
   twice as much "stuff" in it as Pandemic: Legacy. That will add up to
   around 14 or 15 games-worth of content "if you savor it." Each session
   should be around two hours of playtime.

   Each of those 15 games should include classic Legacy-style events,
   fundamentally changing how the game is played. But players aren't
   forced to move the story forward if they don't want to.

   ""I put my heart and soul into it.""

   "It’s possible that during one game all the players decide they're just
   going to attack each other," Daviau said. "It’s just war on the open
   seas. No one reaches any Milestones, no one moves the plot ahead. The
   game will just politely wait, you have your war and when you want to
   get back to the Legacy system we’ll continue with the plot."

   SeaFall will be published in English by [108]Plaid Hat Games, and a
   price has not yet been set. The game is expected to be available this
   August at the Gen Con convention in Indianapolis, Indiana and, after
   working on it so long, Daviau can't wait to get it into player's hands.

   "I put my heart and soul into it," Daviau said. "I spent
   three-and-a-half years on this. But what if this is the one I didn’t
   get right? I’m not worried. I’m just — I don’t want to say I’m an
   artist, because I don’t like the sound of that. It's just that as a
   designer you kind of put something out there and you hope that everyone
   likes this like you think they will.

   "I feel very confident that they will like it, but it doesn’t mean that
   emotionally I’m not thinking, 'Hm… did I miss something?'"

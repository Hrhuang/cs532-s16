A Grammy Category for Game Music Composers

   Posted by [14]Winifred Phillips on [15]February 8, 2016

   [16]grammys-650px It‚Äôs Grammy Awards time!  This coming Monday, the
   National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS) will throw its
   annual party, and many golden gramophones will be awarded to the
   popular recordings that were deemed most worthy this year. This is one
   of the most prestigious honors for any musician. Each year, Grammy
   nominees are selected as representing the top of their field: the very
   best in professional music.  There are 83 Grammy categories this year,
   ranging from famous categories like Album of the Year to lesser known
   categories such as Best Children‚Äôs Album.  Among those 83 categories,
   we don‚Äôt find a Best Video Game Music category listed‚Ä¶ but we do see
   the category Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media (Includes Film, TV,
   Video Games and Other Visual Media).  The Best Score Soundtrack for
   Visual Media category has gone through some interesting transformations
   during the long history of the Grammy Awards. In this article, we‚Äôll be
   taking a walk down memory lane, exploring the ways in which the Visual
   Media category has changed to accommodate video game soundtracks.

   But first, let‚Äôs take a look at a video about the Grammy Awards voting
   process, produced by the National Academy of Recording Arts and
   Sciences and hosted by Recording Academy Awards vice president Bill
   Freimuth.

   In 1999, when the Grammys wanted to recognize music released in a
   soundtrack album, they nominated it in the category Best Instrumental
   Composition Written for A Motion Picture or For Television.  Video game
   soundtracks weren‚Äôt eligible.  So [18]a coalition of game composers and
   game audio pros set about changing that.  The coalition included Murray
   Allen, Alexander Brandon, Ron Hubbard, Michael Land, Mark Miller, Bobby
   Prince, Greg Rahn, George Sanger, Brian Schmidt, Tommy Tallarico,
   Chance Thomas, Tom White, and others.  Together, they lobbied the
   National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences to recognize video game
   music with its own category.  After an awesome concerted effort on the
   part of this coalition, [19]in 2001 the Grammys modified the name of
   the category. Music released on a soundtrack album could thereafter be
   entered into the category Best Instrumental Composition Written for
   Motion Pictures, Television or Other Visual Media.

   While this was a victory of sorts, it [20]stuck in the craw of the most
   passionate supporters of video game music. A full decade passed before
   the category name would be reassessed, and in the meantime, prominent
   members of the game audio community continued to speak out.

   [21]steveschnur1 Steve Schnur, president of the Electronic Arts Music
   Group division, led this renewed effort to establish a Grammy category
   for video game music, and was its most vocal supporter.  ‚ÄúThis
   generalization of ‚ÄòOther Visual Media‚Äô isn‚Äôt merely an insult to the
   video game industry,‚Äù said Schnur, ‚Äúbut a blatant dismissal of these
   composers and their work.‚Äù  Schnur added, ‚ÄúThe current situation must
   be rectified immediately.‚Äù

   In 2011, the Grammys changed the category name to its current
   state: Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media (Includes Film, TV, Video
   Games and Other Visual Media).  This is the category as it exists
   today.  The good?  Video Games are now recognized in the category name.
    The bad?  In the archival database of Grammy winners on the
   official NARAS web site, the category name is shortened to
   just [22]Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media.  No ‚ÄúFilm,‚Äù no ‚ÄúTV,‚Äù
   and no ‚ÄúVideo Games.‚Äù  Also, when reporting on the Grammys, many web
   sites shorten the category name to omit the parenthetical.  So did this
   name change make video game music more visible, or less?  Among
   long-time Grammy voters who are familiar with the Visual Media category
   from the decades of its use as a film/television catch-all, will video
   games seem like an odd addition?  Do people, generally speaking, think
   of video games as a ‚Äúvisual media‚Äù art form?

   [23]apples-oranges Game composers such as ourselves are intimately
   aware that comparing film and television music to game music is an
   ‚Äúapples to oranges‚Äù situation.  After all, the originating dramatic
   medium is drastically different. Games couldn‚Äôt be any more dissimilar
   to films and television programs. An audience watches a film or a
   television program.  A gamer plays a game.  It‚Äôs an active experience.
    The structural divergence in the originating dramatic medium makes the
   genre and style of game music fundamentally distinct. As a result, game
   music is perceived and enjoyed by listeners in unique ways that bear
   little relation to the ways in which film and television music are
   enjoyed.  I explore this idea in more detail in chapter four of my
   book, [24]A Composer‚Äôs Guide to Game Music (beginning on p. 56).

   The game music professional community is still fighting to have game
   soundtracks recognized by a separate category in the Grammy Awards, and
   the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences is not
   unsympathetic to the cause. When the category name was changed to its
   current form in 2011, [25]Recording Academy Awards vice president Bill
   Freimuth said, ‚ÄúI think this could be viewed as a first step in the
   direction of video games getting their own category.‚Äù

   Here‚Äôs hoping that in the future we‚Äôll see a video games category in
   the Grammy Awards.  In the meantime, I‚Äôd like to wish good luck to all
   the talented musical artists up for Grammy awards this year!

       Interesting to note as well that in 2001 Producers and Engineers
       were also acknowledged in the award along with the composer but 5
       years later this practice mysteriously ended and went back to
       Composer only‚Ä¶
       It does strike me as odd that an industry that has been in an
       almost constant state of radical change the past decades is still
       slow in recognising the unique cultural and academic value of other
       mediums like video game music. And I have no doubt that game music
       recognition has been affected by the catch all category title; the
       award has never gone to a game composer and this years nominations
       include no game music‚Ä¶
       Meanwhile the BAFTA‚Äôs gave the games industry a whole event to
       itself and one of the awards is called ‚ÄúAchievement in Sound‚Äù!üòõ

            It‚Äôs cool that the BAFTAs have a whole award event dedicated
            to games! Thanks for the great comment, Sam!

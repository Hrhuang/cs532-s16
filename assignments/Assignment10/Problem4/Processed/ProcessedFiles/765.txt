Rio water concerns overblown, says Canadian Olympic team's chief medic

'Steady progress' being made ahead of 2016 Olympics

   for the triathlon and distance swimming. Bob McCormack, Canada’s chief

   Like many, Bob McCormack was shocked in late July when he read reports
   of high viral levels of sewage contamination in all the Olympic water
   venues in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, site of next year's Summer Games.

   Pictures of dead fish, plastic bags and chocolate milk cartons floating
   around did little to alleviate his concerns, but two trips to Rio over
   the last four months has Team Canada's chief medical officer for the
   2016 Games believing "steady progress" is being made by Olympic
   officials.

   "After learning the background story I feel much better and reassured
   that the risks [of athletes getting sick] will never be zero, but it's
   not the levels of concern that were expressed in some of those
   [Associated Press] reports," McCormack, who visited Rio last week, told
   CBCSports.ca in Toronto on Wednesday.

     'To suddenly put in the infrastructure for a Canadian-type sewage
     system, it's not going to happen in eight months. I've talked to
     rowers and a few kayakers and their concern is ... debris in the
     water and cross winds.' - Bob McCormack, Canada's chief medical
     officer for Rio Olympics

   McCormack, a professor in the faculty of medicine at the University of
   British Columbia and an orthopedic surgeon, has viewed data from the
   extensive testing of the water being conducted on a regular basis.

   While he didn't dispute reports that 50 per cent of the sewage in the
   metropolitan area of Rio goes untreated, McCormack understands
   officials are working to make sure the water quality at the athlete
   venues is acceptable.

   "To suddenly put in the infrastructure for a Canadian-type sewage
   system, it's not going to happen in eight months," he said. "I've
   talked to the rowers and a few kayakers and their concern is not so
   much water quality but debris in the water and the crosswinds."

   In all of the water-based test events held in Rio, McCormack said, no
   Canadians have become ill and only six per cent of international
   athletes.

   McCormack noted Canadian athletes are better educated about the risks
   and how to minimize their chances of getting sick when travelling
   internationally and competing in developing countries.

Issues in lagoon

   His trip to Rio a week ago didn't end without some concern with the
   water. The Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon, where rowing and canoeing will be
   contested, has issues at the bottom of the basin.

   "If there's a heavy rainfall, everything gets washed off land [into the
   water] like here [in Canada] if it was to rain after a long dry spell
   and the oil comes to the top of the road," said McCormack, the CMO for
   Team Canada since 1976. "We have to have contingency plans for
   something like that. Generally, the water has been not bad."

     'A couple of antibiotics a couple of days out and then I drank a can
     of [pop] after the [test] race and had no issues. I'm not worried
     about the water quality at all.' - Canadian long-distance swimmer
     Richard Weinberger

   The highest place of risk, he said, is the Copacabana beach, site of
   the triathlon and marathon (10-kilometre) swim events, where the
   athlete's head is below the water for an extended period. But, as
   McCormack pointed out, the water quality in 2014 was better than the
   international acceptance standards 100 per cent of the time, and 97 per
   cent of the time this year.

   On Wednesday, Canadian long-distance swimmer Richard Weinberger told
   Scott Russell of CBC Sports he took the necessary precautions prior to
   competing in a test event in Rio.

   "A couple of antibiotics a couple of days out and then drank a can of
   [pop] after the race and had no issues," said Weinberger, a bronze
   medallist in the open-water swim at the 2012 London Olympics.

   "I'm not worried about the water quality at all."

   However, there is some worry with sewage entering some areas of
   Guanabara Bay, site of the sailing and aquatic events. But officials
   have been taking measures to divert that sewage and improve the
   infrastructure in the highest-risk areas.

   "I wouldn't drink the water out of the [lagoon]. No one should," said
   McCormack. "That's different than the risk of being on top of the water
   and getting splashed."

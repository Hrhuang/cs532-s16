Great game


   by Ejpelaccio

   Really fun and addictive. Somewhat difficult to play on a phone, and
   when the server gets bogged down (major lag!) or crashes, it's really
   obnoxious. I wish there were ways to be invincible for up to 30
   seconds; so many times you get placed on the board right in front of a
   bigger cell and get eaten before getting to even move, or even worse is
   spawning on top of a virus and exploding immediately. I also wish there
   were quick messages to communicate, although the nonverbal of trying to
   figure out what someone else is trying to communicate can be fun too.
   Also I wish there was a way to decide whether or not to go to the same
   "room." It is super frustrating when you are doing really well in one
   room and have a good idea of the other players, then get stuck in
   another room. Or when you die and then spawn right in front of the
   exact same cell that just ate you, and you get eaten again is enraging.
   Just a simple: "would you like to return to this room, yes or no?"
   would be nice. Also, maybe some extra instructions would be nice. It
   took me a while to figure out what viruses did, or that you could shoot
   them at someone, or eat them if you had enough pieces. Also, when you
   are super tiny and can't pick up anything but dots... It would be nice
   if you could at least pick up mass - your own or mass someone else is
   trying to give you.

Amazing Game. Needs bug fixes


   by Coolio Azcueta

   This is an amazing game, it's free! The game is so much fun and I enjoy
   playing it so much. But it has some problems. Crashes. I hate it when
   the server starts to close and I'm about to win, when a crash comes and
   ruins everything. I was playing, for about 50min in one round and I was
   dominating, surely I would get tons of xp when I'm done. But, of
   course, the game crashes, and I'm left with NO XP. Please Miniclip, if
   your reading this, fix this. It's probably the most annoying part of
   the game, except for the teamers ðŸ˜‚
   Also, I wish there was a quick way to chat with someone. Obviously no
   body would pull up a keyboard in the middle of the game and ask to
   team. Just a simple way to communicate. Like in your other game, Soccer
   Stars, you just have a list of texts you can send to the other player.
   There should be a little button, like near the pause button, where you
   can send these texts. Some examples of these texts are: "team",
   "thanks", "help", "Well played" ect. This would make the game a lot
   more fun to play.
   Also, Miniclip, PLEASE ADD THE OTHER MODES (teams, party,
   experimental). I know you will add these someday, but I just can't
   wait.

Amazing Game


   by Savage Us

   It is not as good as the pc version but it makes the game on the go
   very fun. Sometimes without wifi I lag a little bit but It works 75% of
   the time. I have nothing wrong with the game except one thing. I think
   on holidays or special days, they make it double coins. Making it that
   when you make 1 coin it is 2. Making it easier to rankup and earn the
   special skins that come on that day. I love to play this game in the
   car as long as I have LTE service working. The game needs strong
   service but is fun when you have it. Also, they need a new mode such as
   TimeZone, making it whoever is the biggest for the most amount of time
   ( In a 10 minute period ) Wins that match, and gets a bunch of coins.
   Also maybe a Last Ball Standing, Making it whoever is the last person
   to be eaten wins, and has a reward. I think that such as many other
   games, they need a treasure chest or a randomized item every time you
   log on for 24 hours. ( One chest every 24 hours ) This will make it a
   little easier to earn skins out of the chest and make some easy coins.
   I think power ups in some certain modes may also be a good idea!

   A section of [30]Borussia Dortmund's fans will reportedly boycott part
   of the club's German Cup fixture against Stuttgart on Tuesday evening
   in reaction to inflated ticket prices for the match.

   German outlet [31]DW Sports reported 25 per cent of tickets for the
   away fixture cost fans more than €70 (£54), and a group known as the
   "Kein Zwanni" will boycott the opening 20 minutes of the clash in
   response.

   Dortmund's fans are regarded as some of the best in Europe.

   According to the DW Sports report, 10,000 Borussia Dortmund fans will
   make the trip to the Mercedes-Benz Arena to support their side, a
   journey of roughly 418 kilometres for the travelling party.

   Stuttgart released a statement via their official Facebook page in
   response to the reported boycott, and DW Sports provided an English
   translation of their reasoning behind the ticket pricing:

     Official prices for the German Cup fixture against Borussia Dortmund
     correspond exactly with the ticket prices for the Bundesliga fixture
     against Dortmund earlier this season. Prices were communicated to
     Borussia Dortmund before being put on sale and are unchanged for
     this competition since the 2012/13 season.

   The report also noted that tickets to see Borussia Dortmund play at
   their home stadium, Signal Iduna Park, cost between €7 (£5.40) and €54
   (£42), a significantly less sum than travelling to watch Stuttgart this
   week.

   Those sums wouldn't appear to match up with Stuttgart's claims their
   figures fall in line with what was charged at Signal Iduna Park for the
   two teams' Bundesliga clash in November, when Dortmund won 4-1.

   The Black and Yellows missed their chance to close the gap on
   Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich on Saturday after drawing 0-0 at
   [32]Hertha Berlin, while Stuttgart have won their last four on the
   trot.

   Dortmund's fans will hope their side make the trip worthwhile by
   beating Stuttgart and making it to the DFB-Pokal semi-finals, with
   defeat only promising to leave their fans even further out of pocket.

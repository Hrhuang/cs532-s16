About

   [1454554823446.jpg]

Yarny

   Yarny is a tiny new character made from a single thread of yarn that
   slowly unravels as he embarks on a seemingly larger than life journey.
   [1454554824451.jpg]

ENVIRONMENT

   Inspired by the breath-taking, lush environments of Northern
   Scandinavia, traverse nature’s beauty as well as the dangers that it
   has in store.
   [1454554797556.jpg]

PUZZLES

   Using Yarny’s thread, interact with the environment to swing across a
   tree gap or hitch a ride on a flying kite, no feat is too big. The
   tools may be simple but they have ability to accomplish complex
   puzzles.
   [1454554821514.jpg]

UNDERLYING STORY

   Unlock a heartfelt story re-connecting the memories of a long lost
   family. The tale is told completely without words, and Yarny is the
   bond that ties everything together.

   I wanted to make something more personal, something with more impact.
   The game didn’t have to change the world, or even try, but it had to be

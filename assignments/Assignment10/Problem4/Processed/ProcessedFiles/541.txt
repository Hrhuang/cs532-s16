   At the half, the Trail Blazers lead the short-handed Clippers 50-48.
   Portland can't find the basket without a searchlight from long range --
   4-for-16 from beyond the arc. They're shooting only 40 percent from the
   field and, to make matters worse, they have managed only seven free
   throw attempts. The good news for the Trail Blazers: They're
   controlling the glass, recovering 50 percent of their misses, and have
   kept their turnovers in check (only six).

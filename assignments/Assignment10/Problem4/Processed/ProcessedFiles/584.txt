Harry Lumley Bayshore Community Centre

     * Location:
       Owen Sound, ON
     * Publishing Date:
       January 26, 2016
     * Nominated By:
       Becki Gagnon

1. How would you describe your community’s passion and spirit for hockey?

   Our town has a huge fan base and tons of love for the local OHL team.
   We are known for being the most loyal and very involved! We moved here
   recently because of our son who is addicted to the Hockey Team as well
   as thier moscot. They always make time for the kids weather its a cost
   bump on the way in and out of the locker rooms, or giving them time to
   sign memerbelia for the younglings after the game.

2. What arena project would most benefit from the prize money and what impact
would this project have on your community?

   Harry Lumley Bayshore Centre Hockey arena could use the money to update
   the building. They could update amenities. They have separate parts of
   the arena that are used for other events such as weddings, birthdays
   and outtings. A fresh coat of paint would also make the place seem
   fresh and new! Let's bring the Bayshore back to life! Xo

3. Why should your community be the next Kraft Hockeyville?

   Because we have the best Hockey Team! The whole community gets involved
   and they have a huge fan base! We are one of the loudest, cheerful and
   very caring fan base that I have honestly seen in the OHL for the
   smallest community in the OHL. Although we are new to this community we
   have been traveling an hour to see the games for over a year! Living
   here now just means that we can go to more games ;)

   MARSHALLTOWN, Ia. -— One of Iowa's most revered high school gyms has
   received a face-lift half a century after it opened.

   The Roundhouse in Marshalltown has been a source of community pride
   that it appears on the city's logo on signs as visitors drive into
   town.

   It made its debut in 1965 and was Iowa's largest high school gym.

   There's a different look after a 15-month, $8.5 million project aimed
   at preserving tradition while improving and expanding the facility.

   "I always tell our student-athletes that your community wants to make
   an investment in you," Marshalltown activities director Craig Huegel
   said. "Hopefully it lasts another 50 years."

   The project restores and expands this crown jewel of Iowa high school
   athletics.

   There's a new, gleaming court that will be dedicated to former boys'
   basketball coach and activities director George Funk on Friday.

   The bleachers have been replaced  — while the wood from the old ones
   have been repurposed into coat racks, tables and even a birdhouse that
   are being sold.

   New locker rooms, a weight room, a team meeting room and equipment
   storage facilities are part of the upgrade. A "hall of pride" that has
   trophies honors the past.

   "It's an icon, it's something you don't see every day," said Mark
   Hauser, a 1989 graduate who played basketball and now serves as a coach
   at the school.

   Physical education classes use the court for soccer and other
   activities. The weight room, which includes $100,000 of new equipment,
   also benefits students and athletes, too. There's air conditioning now
   to keep annual graduation ceremonies cool.

   The gym has long been a place to play basketball that opponents love to
   visit.

   "They come in here and they always look up," said Aaron Hauser, a
   basketball player and son of Mark. "They say, 'I like your Roundhouse.'
   "

   The funding came from a bond issue and community donations.

   Aaron said he noticed the differences in the new court when he first
   practiced on it.

   "It's not as slick," Hauser said. "If you were making cuts (in the
   past), you'd fall down three times, at least."

   An addition to the building is expected to be constructed on the north
   side of the Roundhouse. Phase 2 will include a wrestling room and
   scoreboards.That portion of the project is expected to start this year
   and will be paid for by $3.85 million in private fundraising.

   The gym can seat 3,800, a bit smaller than the previous capacity of
   about 5,000.

   "It's a legacy throughout the process," Aaron Hauser said.

Wrestling contributor remembered

   Wayne Endres, who helped develop an iconic piece of equipment found in
   many of the state's high school wrestling rooms, has passed away.
   Endres had a key role in producing the ADAM Wrestling Takedown Machine.
   Former Iowa State wrestler Carl Adams and Endres worked together to
   build the machines, which are mounted on walls to help athletes improve
   their takedown technique.

State swimming splash

   held Saturday. The state meet will be held Feb. 13 at the Marshalltown
   YMCA-YWCA. Races start at 12:30 p.m. [68]Iowa City West will try to win
   a third consecutive team championship. Muscatine is the last school to

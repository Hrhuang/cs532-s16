   Purdy: Another Super Bowl in future for Levi's Stadium?

   SANTA CLARA -- Keith Bruce, chief executive of the Super Bowl 50 Host
   Committee, was buttonholed by an NFL owner before Sunday's kickoff.

   "It's not going to be 30 more years before you have another one," the
   owner said, according to Bruce.

   Another Super Bowl, the owner meant.

   The comment was significant. The 32 NFL owners each have one vote in
   choosing future Super Bowl sites. And until Sunday, the game's last Bay
   Area visit had been in 1985 at Stanford.

   Oh, there were speed bumps this time en route to Levi's Stadium and the
   Broncos' victory over the Panthers. But the event's most important and
   critical elements -- the game itself, the transport to Santa Clara on
   Sunday, security and crowd management, the $13 million raised for
   charity -- were executed in near-flawless fashion. Almost everybody who
   witnessed the show, including that anonymous NFL owner, agreed that the
   Bay Area performed well enough to merit a Super Bowl return visit.

   But when?

   Bruce joked that Levi's executives would love to host the 56th Super
   Bowl in 2022. That's because the NFL will now return to using Roman
   numerals to label its championship game "and that one would be Super
   Bowl LVI."

   Cute. But don't count on it.

   For the past month, Bay Area politicians and boosters talked about
   getting into the regular "Super Bowl rotation" with the likes of Miami
   and New Orleans, who seem to host the game every five or six years.
   That's a positive yet extremely optimistic outlook. Here's why:

   Up first

   Next year's game is in Houston. In February 2018, Super Bowl LII is
   scheduled for Minneapolis. The next few games after that will be up for
   bid. Miami is at the front of the list, after making $350 million in
   stadium improvements. New Orleans, the most popular Super Bowl site,
   also wants another turn and at that point will have gone six years
   without one.

   By then, we're looking at 2021 -- when Los Angeles and Atlanta will
   already have new stadiums constructed. When teams build new stadiums,
   the NFL historically awards them Super Bowls. Expect that to happen
   again.

   When you add it all up, the most realistic next Super Bowl available
   for the Bay Area likely will be Super Bowl LVIII in February 2024. The
   competition to land that game will begin in earnest around 2020 or 2021
   -- assuming the Bay Area actually wants to bid on it.

   That's no flippant remark. Pulling off the last two weeks and game day
   took extraordinary effort and regional cooperation. Santa Clara Mayor
   Jamie Matthews, who poured his heart and soul into the effort,
   announced Monday that he was retiring prematurely from his position
   with more than two years remaining in his term. Matthews said he wished
   to spend more time with his family. But you'd be naive to think the
   draining Super Bowl gantlet had nothing to do with his decision.

   Matthews said it was a thrill to see America's largest sporting event
   unfold in his favorite city. But after spending a few hours at Levi's
   on Sunday to ensure the machinery was working properly, he actually
   went home at 3:30 to watch the game on television. (I erroneously
   reported in Monday's column that he viewed the game from the suite
   tower after seeing him there shortly before kickoff.)

   During the telecast, Matthews was happy to hear Santa Clara's name
   mentioned often alongside the usual San Francisco references -- Jim
   Nantz also threw in a San Jose reference at one point -- and was blown
   away by the gorgeous aerial shots of Silicon Valley. He credited San
   Francisco Mayor Ed Lee with getting the Super Bowl momentum going
   several years ago and building regional cooperation.

   "When we work together, there's nothing we can't accomplish," Matthews
   said.

   So would Matthews want to lead a push that lands another Super Bowl in
   nine or 10 years?

   "I'll root from the sidelines," Matthews said with a smile.

   Bruce's contract with the host committee expires in July. So there's no
   certainty he would be involved in the next Super Bowl effort, either.
   The same holds true for Lee and San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo, whose
   efforts helped his city land the Super Bowl Opening Night event at SAP
   Center as well as the Panthers' practice headquarters at San Jose
   State.

   Indeed, it's quite likely that the only key holdover personality
   involved when Northern California aims for another Super Bowl is 49ers
   owner Jed York, who threw the team's organization behind the effort.
   But one interesting lesson learned may be that Levi's Stadium, York's
   pride and joy, in certain ways works better for a Super Bowl than it
   does for a regular season 49ers game.

   Geography's role

   Geography played a part. The Santa Clara Convention Center, right
   across the street from the stadium, played host to three large pregame
   NFL functions Sunday. The Great America theme park opened its gates and
   hosted fans. The league erected a giant parking lot tent structure to
   keep thousands more entertained with concerts.

   Also, with every local transit agency focused on one mission, it was
   extraordinary how smoothly the spectator load-ins and load-outs seemed
   to function. Santa Clara County VTA trains, for example, moved out
   10,000 passengers within an hour after the final gun. Various other
   Super Bowl lessons -- such as the creation of a dedicated lot for Uber
   drop-offs -- may be applied to 49ers home games.

   In San Francisco, the Super Bowl City fan festival and NFL Experience
   expo were deemed grand successes. Gripes about public spending for the
   event may vanish when economic impact studies are finished. And there
   will surely be tweaks to the template.

   For instance, in 2022 or 2023, half the fans may ride in driverless
   Google cars or buses to the game. Let's see Houston or Minneapolis try
   to match that. But for now, everyone involved in Super Bowl 50 should
   take a breath and a bow. It was worth the wait.

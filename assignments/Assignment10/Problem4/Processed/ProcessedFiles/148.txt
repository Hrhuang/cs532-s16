   Amazon announced today the sudden release of [40]Lumberyard, a free and
   cross-platform game engine which offers developers tight integration
   with the cloud based Amazon Web Services platform and with Twitch (now
   owned by Amazon).

   The engine is based on Crytek’s CRYENGINE, which Amazon had previously
   fully licensed. However, Lumberyard is now a different branch with
   several replacements, and the two engines will continue to diverge in
   future updates. Amazon’s Seattle and Irvine game studios are working
   directly on improving the engine.

   Mike Frazzini, Vice President of Amazon Games, said:

     Many of the world’s most popular games are powered by AWS’s
     technology infrastructure platform. When we’ve talked to game
     developers, they’ve asked for a game engine with the power and
     capability of leading commercial engines, but that’s significantly
     less expensive, and deeply integrated with AWS for the back-end and
     Twitch for the gamer community. We’re excited to deliver that for
     our game developers today with the launch of Amazon Lumberyard and
     Amazon GameLift.

   Amazon GameLift is another new service for deploying, operating, and
   scaling session-based multiplayer games. With Amazon GameLift, Amazon
   Lumberyard developers can quickly scale high-performance game servers
   up and down to meet player demand, without any additional engineering
   effort or upfront costs.

   Josh Atkins, Vice President of Creative Development at 2K Games,
   stated:

     Amazon has been a great partner and we are deeply excited about both
     Amazon Lumberyard and Amazon GameLift. The integration of a
     fantastic game engine with amazing cloud services presents a
     wonderful opportunity for both independent developers and
     established publishers.

   Chris Jones, Chief Technology Officer at Obsidian Entertainment, echoed
   the sentiment:

     Developing and maintaining a back-end infrastructure for multiplayer
     games requires a lot of time, resources, and expertise that are
     beyond the reach of many developers. Amazon GameLift removes much of
     that burden from the developer, allowing them to focus their energy
     on bringing their great game ideas to life.

     lumberyard-diner

   Here’s the current feature set of Amazon Lumberyard as described in the
   press release.

     · Create the highest-quality games—Amazon Lumberyard helps
     developers build rich, engaging, world-class games—from a
     full-featured editor, to native code performance and stunning
     visuals, and hundreds of other features like performant networking,
     cloth physics, character and animation editors, particle editor, UI
     editor, audio tools, weather effects, vehicle systems, flocking AI,
     perception handling, camera frameworks, path finding, and more.
     Developers also have full access to Amazon Lumberyard source code,
     making it easy to customize the technology to create differentiated
     gameplay.

     · Build live, online features in minutes— Live, online games enjoy
     higher engagement and retention than offline games. Amazon
     Lumberyard’s visual scripting tool, with its drag-and-drop graphical
     user interface, makes it easy to build connected game features that
     access AWS services, such as DynamoDB, Lambda, and S3. In minutes,
     game designers can create features such as granting a daily gift or
     sending in-game notifications without having to write a single line
     of code. Amazon Lumberyard also comes integrated with AWS’s C++ SDK
     to provide developers access to dozens of AWS services through
     native C++ code, the most common language used to make games.

     · Reach and engage fans on Twitch— Amazon Lumberyard is integrated
     with Twitch so that developers can build gameplay features that
     engage the more than 1.7 million monthly broadcasters, and more than
     100 million monthly viewers on Twitch. With Amazon Lumberyard’s
     Twitch ChatPlay, developers can use a drag-and-drop visual scripting
     interface to create gameplay features that let Twitch viewers use
     chat to directly impact the game they are watching in real-time. For
     example, with Twitch ChatPlay within Amazon Lumberyard, a developer
     could build a game that lets viewers on Twitch control a character
     or vote on game outcomes using chat commands like “up,” “down,”
     “live,” or “die.” And, the Twitch JoinIn feature within Amazon
     Lumberyard helps developers build games that allow Twitch
     broadcasters to instantly invite their live audiences to join them
     side-by-side in the game, with a single click, while others continue
     to watch.

   [41]lumberyard-room

   Amazon Lumberyard currently supports PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One
   platforms, with additional support for Mac/Linux and iOS/Android coming
   soon. VR support for the Oculus Rift SDK 1.0 is also being completed
   and will be added in a future release due soon.

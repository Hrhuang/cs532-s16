   CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- [122]Chicago Bulls All-Star swingman [123]Jimmy
   Butler will miss an additional 3-4 weeks with a left knee sprain, the
   team announced on Tuesday, meaning he will not play in the All-Star
   Game in Toronto on Sunday.

   Butler suffered the knee sprain during the second quarter of last
   Friday night's loss to the [124]Denver Nuggets. Initially, the Bulls
   did not believe the injury was going to be too serious, but a
   subsequent checkup on Tuesday caused them to shut Butler down for at
   least another month.

    [126]Fantasy fallout from Jimmy Butler's injury
       John Cregan serves up the fallout in fantasy basketball from Jimmy
       Butler's latest injury, including which Bulls you should add.

   Butler will sit out the All-Star Game after being voted to the team for
   the second straight season. The league announced that teammate Pau
   Gasol will take Butler's place at All-Star Weekend.

   Gasol is averaging 17 points and 10.9 rebounds per game this season.
   He'll go to his second straight All-Star Game and sixth overall.

   Butler's absence comes at the worst possible time for the Bulls given
   that they enter Wednesday's game against the [127]Atlanta Hawks having
   lost 12 of their last 17 games. Butler, who was open all year about his
   desire to play in all 82 games this season after making a bet with his
   trainer, missed his first game of the year on Feb. 3 because of left
   knee tendinitis.

   Bulls head coach Fred Hoiberg acknowledged after Monday's shootaround
   that while Butler was improving, he still had soreness in the knee.
   When asked why there was still no clear-cut timeline for Butler's
   return, Hoiberg admitted he wasn't sure.

   "Good question," he said. "It's what it is right now. It's an injury
   that a lot of it is based on how he recovers, and the important thing
   is, he's making progress. We'll continue to get him treatment, and if
   he can continue to make progress, a lot of this will be based on how he
   feels."
   [r51028_576x324_16-9.jpg&w=130&h=130&scale=crop&location=center] The
   Bulls will be without All-Star guard Jimmy Butler for about a
   month. Gary Dineen/NBAE via Getty Images

   Butler leads the league in minutes, averaging 37.9 a game. The Bulls
   also played without [128]Derrick Rose in a loss to the [129]Charlotte
   Hornets on Monday. Rose cited general body soreness as his reason for
   sitting out. The only silver lining for a Bulls team that is already
   playing without [130]Joakim Noah (season-ending shoulder surgery) and
   [131]Nikola Mirotic (appendectomy and hematoma removal -- return
   unclear) is that veteran [132]Mike Dunleavy made his season debut on
   Saturday after missing the entire year up to that point due to
   offseason back surgery. With Butler out of the lineup for the
   foreseeable future, the Bulls will have to rely on young players
   [133]Tony Snell and [134]Doug McDermott, both of whom have struggled to
   produce despite being given spots in the rotation this season.

   The Bulls said in a statement that Butler has already started the rehab
   process and "he will be allowed to engage in all activities as
   tolerated with the primary goal of maintaining his conditioning over
   the ensuing weeks."

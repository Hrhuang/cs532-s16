Championship

     * It wasn’t the best day for the Championship’s two big-spenders, as
       both Middlesbrough and Derby County failed to win after
       strengthening their respective sides in January. Boro left new £9m
       signing Jordan Rhodes on the bench against his former side
       Blackburn Rovers, but [54]could only draw 1-1 after Jordi Gomez
       gave Rovers the lead, with David Nugent equalising shortly
       afterwards. Derby also came from behind to draw, Craig Bryson
       levelling to make it 1-1 against Fulham, but that made it seven
       games without a win for Paul Clement’s side.
     * They are however just five points behind leaders Hull City, who
       suffered a defeat to the Championship’s form side in Burnley, as
       Sam Vokes gobbled up a rebound after a Joey Barton shot was saved,
       giving them [55]a 1-0 victory at Turf Moor. The Clarets are third
       in the table, but a single point separates the top three.
     * Sheffield Wednesday moved into the playoff places after completing
       a remarkable comeback against Birmingham City at St Andrew’s. The
       Owls lost keeper Kieren Westwood and Sam Hutchinson to injuries in
       the first-half and were 1-0 down going into the closing stages, but
       two goals in three minutes from Gary Hooper secured three
       impressive points for Wednesday. They move above Ipswich Town, who
       lost 1-0 to QPR thanks to a Matt Phillips header.
     * At the bottom of the table, Bolton Wanderers moved off the bottom
       on goal difference after they grabbed a crucial 2-1 win at home to
       Rotherham United, Kaiyne Woolery scoring the winner in injury-time.
       They move above Charlton Athletic, who suffered a limp 1-0 home
       defeat to Bristol City, with [56]new Robins manager Lee Johnson
       watching from the stands.

League One

     * Burton Albion moved four points clear at the top of League One
       after clinching a convincing 3-1 victory over Bradford City. Mason
       Bennett, Tom Naylor and Mark Duffy grabbed the goals, as Nigel
       Clough’s side extended their lead over the side in second place.
     * That side is Walsall, who suffered a surprise 3-0 loss at home to
       Millwall. Lee Gregory scored twice while debutant Mahlon Romeo
       scored the other for Millwall, who won their fourth game in the
       last five to move into the top six.
     * Wigan Athletic are third following their 2-0 win at Sheffield
       United, moving above Gillingham who could only draw 0-0 against
       Swindon. Southend United are seventh following their 3-0 victory
       against bottom side Colchester.

League Two

     * League Two was hit by a number of postponements after the bad
       weather, but Northampton Town consolidated their position at the
       top with a 2-0 victory over York City, goals from John-Joe O’Toole
       and Marc Richards securing the three points, with the other sides
       in the automatic promotion places, Oxford United and Plymouth
       Argyle, denied a chance to play.
     * Mansfield Town and Leyton Orient also took advantage of immediate
       rivals being out of action, securing 2-1 and 1-0 victories over
       Morecambe and Portsmouth respectively.
     * Other games that survived saw Carlisle United complete a 2-0
       victory over Accrington Stanley, Crawley Town won 1-0 at Stevenage,
       Cambridge beat Dagenham and Redbridge 1-0 while Luton Town won 1-0
       at Wycombe.

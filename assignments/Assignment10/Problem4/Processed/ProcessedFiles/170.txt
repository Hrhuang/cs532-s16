   OTTAWA — While the Lightning will play in Jonathan Drouin's hometown of
   Montreal tonight, the suspended wing continues to work out and skate on
   his own somewhere in the city.

       2 Months Ago

       3 Weeks Ago
     * [394]Desperate for scoring, Lightning calls up Jonathan Drouin
       3 Weeks Ago

   That has been Drouin's routine since he did not show up for the Jan. 20
   game for AHL Syracuse, leading to the indefinite suspension without
   pay. Drouin, who requested a trade in November, doesn't want to suffer
   a deal-altering injury, so he waits in limbo, with no timetable on when
   — or if — the No. 3 pick from 2013 gets his desired fresh start.

   It's not a fun situation, according to Senators C Kyle Turris, 26, who
   went through a somewhat similar saga five years ago. Turris, the No. 3
   overall pick in 2007 by the Coyotes, didn't feel he was getting used
   correctly in Arizona. So he requested a trade in summer 2011 and held
   out the first six weeks of the season as an unsigned restricted free
   agent.

   Turris remains grateful it worked out, saying a trade to Ottawa in
   December 2011 saved his career, but said it wasn't easy to ask for a
   trade and invite public scrutiny.

   "It's tough," Turris said. "Everyone has mixed feelings, and especially
   not being an established player. Then people are doubting that you're
   doing the right thing, you really have to have confidence in yourself
   and your ability to do it.

   "It was very difficult to do. You're getting a lot of heat from the
   media and people, and people within the organization. It was a tough,
   tough go."

   The Turris-Drouin scenarios were different in that Turris was a
   restricted free agent without a contract when he held out, as opposed
   to Drouin who is still in his entry-level deal.

   "Legally, I didn't do anything wrong," Turris said.

   Turris got his wish, being dealt to Ottawa for David Rundblad and a
   second-round pick. Suddenly, Turris was playing on the second line with
   then-captain Daniel Alfredsson. Now Turris is coming off back-to-back
   20-plus goal seasons and is on pace for a third with 13 goals in 47
   games this season.

   "(The Senators) put me in a situation where I could grow and develop
   into the player that I can become, and still working to improve on,"
   Turris said. "With that growth came confidence, because I had success,
   that combination of confidence and experience and being able to go
   through those situations, it's just been huge to give me that
   opportunity here, it saved me."

   FAMILIAR FACE: RW Erik Condra, who played his first five NHL seasons
   with the Senators, said it was emotional playing against his former
   team in Ottawa. "You get the giddies a little bit," Condra said.

   G Ben Bishop, another former Senator, hoped to start, and has a 8-0-3
   career record against Ottawa. But Bishop knowing he'd play tonight in
   Montreal, understood the Lightning's decision to start Andrei
   Vasilevskiy. Bishop is 10-1-3 in his career against the Canadiens.

   TRADE WINDS: Blues director of player personnel Rob DiMaio attended
   another Lightning game; St. Louis is believed to be interested in
   Drouin. The Stars had two reps listed for the second straight Tampa Bay
   game.

   LINING UP: D Anton Stralman (flu) played. RW Jonathan Marchessault and
   D Matt Carle were scratched.

   Senators' Kyle Turris relates to Jonathan Drouin's trade request

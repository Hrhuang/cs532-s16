   Taft School District 90 Superintendent Dr. D.J. Skogsberg has been
   named the new superintendent for the Orland Park School District.

   Skogsberg, who game to District 90 in 2012 from Orland Park, will take
   over as superintendent for the school district for the 2016/2017 school
   year.

   “Dr. Skogsberg has done all that the board has asked him to do to move
   us forward for the benefit of our children,” said Taft School Board
   President Tony Peloso of Skogsberg’s 4-year tenure.

   “We hate to see him go,” said Peloso adding that the board would begin
   its search for a new superintendent.

   Skogsberg’s contract was set to expire at the end of the 2015-2016
   school year and declined a 1-year extension in the spring of 2015.

   Skogsberg admitted that he was, “a bit taken aback” when he was first
   approached about returning to the Orland Park School District where he
   served as Assistant Director of Curriculum, Instruction and Assessment
   from 2010-2012. The district includes 10 schools with a population of
   around 5,000 students.

   Skogsberg credited his time “in Orland Park as a leader in the
   curriculum department” as helping him to gain the necessary experience
   to take on the role of superintendent at Taft.

   “To be asked to return is humbling and I’m grateful to the members of
   both school boards for the opportunities to work with the students,
   parents, and staff.”

   “I will miss working at Taft and I look forward to reconnecting with
   the Orland Park learning community,” said Skogsberg.

   Super Bowl fans may be playing Monday morning quarterback today, but
   the stories that most shake up the sports world aren’t recaps of what
   happens on the field. L. Jon Wertheim, executive editor of Sports
   Illustrated, says the biggest headlines are won by investigative
   stories, from accusations of cheating in professional sports to high
   school hazing.

   For this week’s podcast, Wertheim talks with ProPublica senior editor
   Joe Sexton about some of his favorite examples, how Sports Illustrated
   has adjusted to investigative journalism in the digital age, and what
   his new book – [22]This Is Your Brain on Sports: The Science of
   Underdogs, the Value of Rivalry, and What We Can Learn from the T-Shirt
   Cannon – reveals about the psychology of sports.

   Highlights from their conversation:

     * Media outlets may have fewer resources for investigative sports
       reporting than they once did, but the public is still hungry for
       those stories.
       Wertheim: I'm bullish about the public's appetite. Look at this [Al
       Jazeera America] [24]Peyton Manning human growth hormone story and
       the attention that got. … Say whatever you want to say about the
       report and the methodology, and whether or not you or I would have
       published that story or not published it – that was the sports
       story of the week at a time when the NFL was finishing the regular
       season and college football bowl games were in full force. I think
       the public appetite for a well-executed sports investigative story
       is as high as it's ever been.
     * Gambling is at the heart of many difficulties for sports – but
       provides opportunities for investigative reporting.
       Wertheim: We did [25]a story on daily fantasy – on DraftKings and
       FanDuel and the revenues, and these valuations that were going up
       and up and up to unicorn status. … If someone had said, by the end
       of the season there's going to be an Attorney General's cease and
       desist, there’s going to be this unending constellation of court
       cases, and these companies with billion-dollar valuations, we don't
       know if they're going to exist anymore – it's a remarkable story.
       It's very fluid and fast moving. A ruling here or there will really
       sway things. I think one of the reasons the NBA seemed to reverse
       their stand is because there was this recognition that gambling
       ain't going away. People's interest in uncertain outcomes isn't
       going to go away. That's a founding virtue of this country. If you
       can't beat them, join them.
     * In his most recent books, Wertheim takes a “Freakonomics approach”
       to the psychology of sports.
       Wertheim: One of the things we looked at [in Scorecasting,
       co-written by Tobias Moskowitz] were: Why is there a home field
       advantage in sports? I thought we made a pretty strong case, and
       it's not about fans waving their arms or booing the visitors and
       cheering the home teams. It's a lot about this officiating bias.
       Whether it's balls and strikes, or whether it's foul calls, the
       home team does very, very well, and the officials are really making
       the difference. … This new book [This Is Your Brain on Sports: The
       Science of Underdogs, the Value of Rivalry, and What We Can Learn
       from the T-Shirt Cannon, co-written by Sam Sommers] does the same
       kind of thing: We know that rivalries are good, but why is that? We
       think that lousy players make for better managers and star players
       make for lousy managers – why is that?

A-Game tenants mulling over latest proposal from ownership

   A-Game's leasing tenants said they will closely vet a proposal
   ownership [59]presented late Saturday afternoon that could keep the
   facility open through the end of March.

   Alliance Volleyball Director Jeff Wismer said the group's legal team at
   Butler | Snow will closely examine what ownership presented. In the
   offer proposed by Sports Land Group, the owners would like to meet with
   the nonprofits' leaders before Wedesday, Feb. 10 at 5 p.m. SLG said
   they wish to work out a deal that would allow ownership to stop losing
   money and allow volleyball and hockey to finish their seasons in the
   facility while also preparing to find a new home.

   Hockey season finishes around March and volleyball doesn't end until
   the third week of June.

   Part of the deal would enclose the nonprofits receiving some money back
   in return as the facility shuts down.

   Upon the closing of the sale, SLG would deposit $2 million of the
   closing proceeds into an escrow account ($1 million for the benefit of
   MDG and $1 million for the benefit of Alliance). The escrowed funds
   would be available to fund any legally permissible damages to which MDG
   and/or Alliance may be entitled arising from the lawsuit currently
   pending in the Williamson County Chancery Court (Case No. 44784).
   Recoveries would not be limited to the amount of the escrowed funds.

   "They are concerned of the perplexity of the group," he said. "They are
   looking at the escrow accounts and the validity that they can give that
   money."

   [60]On Friday afternoon, legal representatives for volleyball and
   hockey/figure skating filed an expedited motion for a judge to reverse
   the previous decision and to review their leasing agreements. Alliance
   and MDG have legally enforceable leases which expire in September 2017
   and December 2019. They asked a judge to expedite that motion and hear
   it no later than tomorrow, Feb. 9.

   The group had a judge lift a temporary restraining order against itself
   [61]last Tuesday. [62]Two days later, Alliance Volleyball and MDG
   Managment, which handles hockey, had to retrieve their personal
   belongings from A-Game after finding it abruptly locked on Thursday
   morning.

   [63]A-Game users protested for its opening Thursday night in a march
   from the CoolSprings Galleria mall to the complex at 215 Gothic Court,
   waving signs at cars in exchange for honks of support.

   In the meantime, Alliance Volleyball will lay down hardwood in the
   Williamson County Ag Expo center starting Monday night for players to
   use during the next five days. During the weekend, Harpeth Hall opened
   up their gyms to let them practice.

   "It's an unbelievable story," Wismer said. "For those who are
   questioning city and county, they are the ones opening up their doors
   and for them to make this viable and to get those courts here. We also
   have families willing to volunteer to get these courts up."

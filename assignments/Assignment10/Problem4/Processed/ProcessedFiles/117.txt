   Still waiting for a co-op game set in the Android universe. Would love
   to see a game where everybody is a runner working competitively to take
   down a corporation. Each corporation could have it's own flavor,
   similar to Eldritch/Arkham Horror ancient ones.

   I guess I just want Android Horror.

   That's what I thought Android: Mainframe was going to be when I started
   reading about multiple runners. FF should make this happen. Still,
   Mainframe looks like a cool game to try out.

   Android: Infiltration is partially co-op, since the runners need to
   work mostly together to get as much information out as possible - and
   if nobody gets out, nobody wins. So there is an incentive to work
   together, somewhat.

   I love Infiltration and we play it a lot. I'm so surprised more people
   haven't heard about it. My 40-something-year-old eyes wish the cards

   It's not fully cooperative. If someone gets out, he/she keeps all their
   downloaded data. At the end of the game, from those who got out of the
   building by the time the police arrived, the one with most data wins
   the game.

   In the competitive version, yes. It promotes co-operation to a point.

   There is a variant where you work together to get the most data as a
   team, to set a high score goal for yourself.

   No, no, no... A game where various executives of benign mega
   corporations maximize their profits while stimying the efforts of
   anarcho-terrorist runners.

   If they released a co-op of this one, it'd just be Burgle Bros. But I
   like your idea. Would it be set in the real world with bouts in the
   cyber world, like how Arkham does other dimensions?

   That is very similar to my thoughts that the Call of Cthulhu LCG should
   have had the Lord of the Rings LCG rules where you all play a team of
   investigators/mediums/thugs who are trying to solve a mystery while
   creepy cultists and monsters are trying to stop you.

   I was expecting something heavier, and I'm unexpectedly excited at how
   light it looks. It's SO much easier to bring players to the table when
   you have a shorter, easier game. This one looks like it has a nice
   level of strategy and tactical potential, while being easy to learn and
   having an awesome theme. This could be awesome gateway material.

   Similar feelings here. I'm a mixture of disappointed this isn't heavier
   and happy it's light enough I'll be able to get non-Netrunner players
   to play it.

   Android itself is already gratuitously heavy, and Netrunner is an LCG
   and that says everything.

   Really, the setting is "due" for a lighter game, especially since
   Infiltration is OOP now.

   From my understanding it's very similar to some other "adventure" games
   FFG used to sell (there was a series of them), where you're playing
   risk/reward of how much you can steal before escaping. Otherwise you
   get locked-in and lose. Is it something like that?

   Basically. You draw from a deck of cars and "make" the two floors of
   the building. You have to go in and steal stuff from each room, and
   also rooms have various effects. The further you go in, you generally
   have to go back out the same way, and each turn a counter counts up a
   random amount, when it gets to 99 I believe or above the cops come and
   if you're not out you lose.

   I am still dreaming of a nice, complex, theme heavy cyberpunk game in
   the Android or Shadowrun universe. I like Android Netrunner and it has
   good theme, but I want to put a team together and infiltrate a
   corporation or have some kind of campaign. Basically make the shadowrun
   video games into a board game and I would be happy.

   Edit: Ok guys, I do not need all the cyberpunk games out there
   mentioned to me. I didn't mention them to keep my post short, but I am
   aware of them and while all have pieces of what I want, none have quite
   reached the bar (which bgg ratings for them reflect, none are bad but
   none are quite at that point of being amazing).

   It's a polarizing game. And it's easy to see why.

   It's a beast to learn. It takes a while to play. And it has a pretty
   strong "take that!" mechanism, which can really bug people.

   But as a game that tells a narrative story, I honestly think it is
   second-to-none (in my experiences). Because it still has a strong
   "game" aspect. Other narrative games like Tales of the Arabian Nights,
   Agents of SMERSH or even Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective, they are
   almost like a choose-your-own-adventure-book style of game. Android is
   a story told through both narrative nature of the cards and game's
   mechanisms. Things make sense within the story. And I gathered that
   from only playing 1/2 of a game. (Between learning the game, and
   getting a feel for it, it took us over 6 hours to get half way through
   the game)

   It is a massive game. It had a lot of pieces and parts moving around. A
   lot of things going on. And with repeated plays, it would move a lot
   faster.

   I felt the the objective and strategy was a bit obfuscated. But I also
   felt very intrigued by my own story that was being told.

   I know some people were turned off by the mechanisms. There is this
   puzzle thing, you find who is guilty by piling on the most evidence on
   them (Reverse deduction, as opposed by normal deduction), and the take
   that element seems a bit off with a game that has a lot of
   euro-inspired mechanisms. I felt that it was a real challenge to play
   well.

   But you can't ignore the game being a facilitator for the story, while
   still being a traditional board game from head-to-toe.

   The game's theme is very strong, and I love the part of advancing in
   your personal story. However, in terms of gameplay I think the game has
   a bit of an identity crisis as it's trying to group 3 different
   (mini)-games into one.

   The main section of the board has you explore tokens to find evidence
   for your guilty hunch. Next to that, you're playing out your personal
   storyline while hampering other players in theirs. Lastly, you're
   trying to connect pieces of a conspiracy puzzle in a way so that others
   cannot snatch the victory points away from you. Each of these games,
   while having a thematic connection, have barely any connection within
   the game mechanics. This makes the game, to me, feel very disjointed.

   Furthermore, the scoring is rather abstract, making it quite difficult
   to track down how many victory points the other players have
   accumulated (or were soon to receive). This makes using the dark cards
   more of a thematic choice than a strong gameplay decision.

   The game gets most of its flack for having a really vague method of
   determining who the perpetrator is. For the reliance it has on theme,
   this is a bit broken when it feels like you're stacking evidence
   against someone you want to be guilty, rather than someone who is
   guilty.

   That said, I'm quite glad that the theme survived into Android:
   Netrunner, and now in Android: Mainframe.

   That's super thematic for the Android universe. These are washed up
   cops, broke ass bounty hunters, etc. If you interpret the mechanics as
   planting evidence, it makes sense. I interpret it as as mini
   choose-your-own-adventure decision and not planting, and it still makes
   sense.

   I thought the idea behind you stacking evidence to prove someone
   guilty, rather then discover who is guilty, was due to each character
   having their own personal agenda. That they either KNOW who the real
   murderer is or they just want someone removing they don't like. In
   either case, it gives me the thematically feel of being a dirty cop,
   and I LOVE that!

   As with some of the larger FF games out there, there is a lot of
   individual components to the game to keep track of, but how you
   interact with them is really simple.

   For example, you get six actions a turn (and a big time sheet with a
   marker on to show this is provided and also has the actions available
   on it), enter a ritzy location gets you a positive 'light' card to
   benefit your character and a seedy location gets you a negative 'dark'
   card to harm your opponents (you get these just by moving around, a
   very passive element of the game), and gathering evidence to place on
   your allocated guilty and innocent suspects to either...make them
   appear guilty or innocent! Or trade in those pieces of evidence for a
   piece of the conspiracy board (you place jigsaw pieces that connect
   from an inner-most square to a point at the edge of the conspiracy
   board to give every player extra bonuses and extra benefits for you
   along the way), or focus on your characters personal story for BIG
   points - which you have cards telling you exactly what to do for that.

   So, as you can see there are lots of little bits of pay attention to
   but they all come down to using time to do one of three things; placing
   evidence on your guilty or innocent hunches or trading them in for a
   conspiracy piece OR just meeting the criteria on your story card.

   Give the game another try, it's one of the most immersive and fun
   experiences I've had playing with friends around dinner table.

   It's...ok. There are some really cool ideas in it and the theme is
   really strong, but as one cohesive game it's a mess. I feel like they
   tried to put too much into the game and it feels disjointed. I would
   LOVE for FFG to revisit it and streamline it a bit.

   But if they stream-lined the game then every player would play the game
   in a similar manner, and every game would become more or less the same.
   The game works strongest for having lots of replay value as each
   character has their own pro's and con's that are reflected in how you
   approach playing the game: Some are better at gathering evidence
   quicker, some benefit from the conspiracy board more, some have greater
   access to light and dark cards, and others are great in-betweeners. And
   everyone has a shot with their personal stories!

   You won't be able to participate in everything within the game during a
   single play-through and its up to you to make sure you can take
   advantage of how the game is progressing in order to win, which becomes
   more prominent during the second week of the game, as the conspiracy
   board begins to fill, evidence gets removed and plots are well
   underway. In other words, the further into the game you are, the more
   stream-lined the game becomes.

   It is definitely a game that works best with more players, but my point
   is that whilst it may feel disjointed to you, this is probably because,
   by comparison to other board games, it has a very wide breath of ways
   to interact with the game (which ARE connected) which make up the
   greater Android world.

   I had fun without even playing the game, just watching others.

   The gameplay was a little rough as all the players but one were new,
   but he kept things moving well enough.

   It might not be the best bang for your buck as a mechanics game, but it
   is the most immersive and interesting theme game I've ever seen. The
   story was worth the time, the gameplay was a bonus.

   I think it's a fairly bad game. I really wanted to like it since it's
   what Dominus is talking about and I yearn for the same, but it landed

   So I loooooooove me some Android, and am a big fan of FFG.

   But reading that makes me think of the game I used to play with my dad
   on the back of kid's menus at diners, where you make a grid of dots and
   draw lines to close up areas. Like that with special powers. Not
   necessarily a bad thing, but unexpected.

   Edit: Also, that box art is awesome.

   I agree, it feels like their take on Blockus. It could be a lot of fun,
   those sorts of competitive puzzle games are great for mixed groups who
   might not humor me with Dead of Winter.

   It seems like a retheme of Bauhaus, by the same designer (surprise!),
   only this version looks like it comes with a nice inset board to hold
   the pieces in place. Pictures of Bauhaus on BGG look like parts are

   I'm not sure if this is something you can comment on, but is the board
   modular pieces? It looks like two "shells" that small little rectangles
   fit into.

   I'm trying to determine if it's an inset setup that will hold all the
   little "walls" and player-tokens in place or not.

   The box art looks amazing. The game sounds like a family-style abstract
   strategy in the same vain as Ingenious, Blockus and Through the Desert.

   To be honest, I was hoping they'd start focusing less on the runners
   vs. corporations aspect of their universe. We have Android: Netrunner
   and Android: Infiltration already.

   I was very excited to see another Android game. But this one isn't
   really revving up my engine.

   As someone who is into abstract, puzzle-y games, I think this looks

   Yeah, it does look a bit like it, especially with the grid board. I
   have a feeling that it'll play significantly different though. You're
   still boxing in people on a grid and such, but you're going for zone
   control, rather than moving across the board.

   First impression is a competitive version of [1159]Shadowrun Crossfire
   without single player, or campaign, and less cards and simpler...
   Unless this turns out to be far better than first impressions would

Argos agree to terms with veteran lineman Bourke

   The Canadian Press
   Published Tuesday, February 9, 2016 3:06PM EST

   TORONTO -- The Toronto Argonauts have agreed to terms with veteran
   offensive lineman Josh Bourke.

   Bourke, 33, a native of Windsor, Ont., spent nine seasons with the
   Montreal Alouettes before heading to Toronto shortly after becoming a
   free agent Tuesday.

   The towering six-foot-seven, 315-pound Bourke, the CFL's top lineman in
   2011, is a two-time league all-star and was a fixture on Montreal's
   offensive line at left tackle.

   Montreal selected Bourke in the third round, No. 21 overall, in the
   2004 CFL draft but he opted to remain at Grand Valley State for his
   senior season. He signed with the NFL's Green Bay Packers in 2006
   before being released the next season and joining the Alouettes.

   Earlier on Tuesday, the Argos lost free-agent quarterback Trevor Harris
   to the Ottawa Redblacks.

   Toronto also agreed to a one-year deal with kicker Lirim Hajrullahu,
   who made 22-of-32 field goals (68.8 per cent) last year with Winnipeg.
   Veteran Swayze Waters, the CFL's top special-teams player in 2014,
   battled injuries most of last season and is a free agent.

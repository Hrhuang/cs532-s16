Eagles Look For Strong Pitching Staff To Lead The Way

   Eagles Look For Strong Pitching Staff To Lead The Way
   Feb 09, 2016

   Wednesday: The Catchers

   BRIDGEWATER, Va. â€“ The Bridgewater College pitching staff could
   certainly be the strengths of the team during the upcoming season.

   The Eagles return third-team all-conference selections [188]Ryan Leake
   and [189]Steven Woerner to headline the 2016 staff. Leake returns to
   his starting slot on the weekend while Woerner will assume a new role
   this season at the back end of games.

   Leake led the team in innings pitched and finished with a 5-4 record
   while posting a sterling 2.02 earned run average. The senior relies on
   a good fastball and a plus changeup, giving head coach Curt Kendall one
   of the top lefties in the conference.

   Woerner will move to the bullpen as the team's "finisher."

   "We're not calling him a closer, he'll be a finisher," said Kendall.
   "Some days he could pitch the ninth, some days we might ask him to go
   three innings. We feel like it's a role he is well-suited for and it's
   a way for us to utilize him more."

   Joining Leake on the weekend could be fellow senior [190]Justin Petock.
   The righthander has pitched 106 innings during his first three seasons
   and has a 7-3 record with six saves and a solid 4.08 ERA. "Justin gives
   us a very experienced option on the mound and he's going to be in the
   starting mix."

   Also looking to nail down rotation spots are lefty [191]Brady Cockerham
   and sophomores [192]Chad Lenz, [193]Johnny LaVoie and [194]Ian Mayes.
   Each started at least two games a year ago and each turned in at least
   one stellar start.

   Cockerham, a southpaw, made 15 appearances with two starts and both
   starts were gems. Cockerham pitched a seven-inning shutout in a 4-0 win
   over Penn St.-Harrisburg. He worked into the ninth inning in a game
   against Wesley where he finished by allowing three runs in 8.1 innings
   in the Eagles' 4-3 victory.

   Lenz, another lefty, made seven starts with two of his best coming in
   conference play. He allowed one earned run in five innings in a win
   over Eastern Mennonite and allowed zero earned runs in seven
   innings during a win over Hampden-Sydney.

   LaVoie made three starts with his best coming against a strong Mary
   Washignton team when he gave up just four hits in seven shutout innings
   in a no-decision.

   Mayes struggled for much of his first season, but he finished strong.
   He pitched seven innings and allowed seven hits and three earned runs
   in a late-season non-conference victory over N.C. Wesleyan.

   In addition to that group, Kendall also thinks freshman [195]Tristan
   Daywalt could figure into the starting mix.

   "I really feel comfortable in the fact I have six or seven different
   guys who can start," said Kendall. "The ones who don't end up starting
   will certainly be valuable pieces of our bullpen."

   Another wildcard in the rotation could be lefty [196]Jordan Showalter.
   After turning in a strong freshman season in 2014, Showalter missed the
   2015 season due to arm surgery. Kendall believes the lefty could be at
   full strength for the stretch run this season.

   In addition to Woerner, Kendall will have another side-armer at his
   disposal as sophomore [197]Kyle Jones returns after a solid first year.
   Jones made 13 appearances and finished with a 4-1 record. "Kyle dropped
   down to sidearm for the first time last year and he really pitched
   well. We threw him to the wolves in some tough situations and he did
   the job. He's another experienced guy we can go to."

   Sophomores [198]Josh Lasam and [199]Jarrett Horton also threw some
   quality innings for the Eagles a year ago. "Lasam is a guy who can come
   in and be pretty effective for an inning or two in relief. Horton's
   another guy who, when healthy, can be effective," said Kendall.

   In addition to Daywalt, the Eagles have several more first-year arms
   capable of contributing on the mound. "[200]Samuel Imeson has een
   throwing the ball well and [201]Andrew Berry has been a pleasant
   surprise. Both those guys are lefties and then you have [202]Jeff Early
   and [203]Ryan Mason from the right side. All those guys are talented
   arms."

   Kendall believes the staff is set up to perform well not only this
   season, but into the future.

   "We have some pretty talented arms in the freshmen and sophomore
   class," said Kendall. "Overall this season, I feel like we have a
   strong and deep staff. We have a lot of depth and we should be able to
   keep our arms fresh throughout the season."

   Bridgewater opens the season this weekend with a pair of games at
   Christopher Newport. The Eagles open their home schedule on Feb. 16
   against Averett University.

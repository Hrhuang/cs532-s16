Pull on your trainers - it's time to Beat the Street

   People in Wolverhampton are being urged to team up and Beat the Street
   in an exciting new walking challenge being launched this month.

   Beat the Street, an exciting new walking challenge, begins in
   Wolverhampton later this month
   Exciting new walking challenge

   Beat the Street is a 7 week walking and cycling challenge in which
   residents can collect points for the number of miles they travel on
   foot or bike. Everyone can take part with prizes for individuals and
   their teams up for grabs, including a share of £5,000 worth of prizes
   for the teams that travel the furthest during the challenge.

   The challenge, which has been launched by the City of Wolverhampton
   Council's Public Health team as part of its Call to Action to tackle
   the growing obesity epidemic facing the city, has been a massive hit
   when it has been staged in other parts of the UK and America.

   The game takes place from Wednesday 24 February until Wednesday 13
   April, 2016. To play, people should pick up their Beat the Street card
   from a range of venues, including their local library, leisure centre,
   community centre or Wolverhampton Art Gallery, and register online at
   [88]Beat the Street.

   To log their journeys, players simply tap their card against 2 of the
   190 or so special sensors, called Beat Boxes, which will be placed on
   lampposts across Wolverhampton.

   Tapping the card against the nearest Beat Box at the start of their
   journey, and another at the end, will calculate the distance travelled.
   Points are awarded and recorded against the card and will go towards
   their individual and team total and towards the city's overall
   challenge total.

   Players can monitor their progress by logging on to the Beat the Street
   website and top scorers - including teams and individuals - will be in
   the running for some great prizes.

   As well as individuals and families, schools in Wolverhampton are being
   invited to take part with pupils, staff and parents joining forces to
   Beat the Street, while voluntary organisations and businesses large and
   small are also encouraged to form teams and enter the challenge.

   Councillor Sandra Samuels, the City of Wolverhampton Council's Cabinet
   Member for Public Health and Wellbeing, said: "Beat the Street is a
   hugely exciting programme that has really got people involved wherever
   it has taken place.

   "We're very excited about it coming to Wolverhampton this spring as it
   will encourage local residents and families to become more physically
   active whilst also having great fun at the same time."

   Beat the Street is run by Intelligent Health and founder Dr William
   Bird said: "We want to see adults and children across Wolverhampton
   getting involved and really enjoying the game.

   "Walking is one of the easiest and most cost-effective ways of getting
   fitter and healthier and Beat the Street has been designed to ensure
   that people really get the most out of it, from meeting people on the
   streets and exploring their local area through to improving their
   health and wellbeing."

   Anyone interested in taking part in Beat the Street should click onto
   [89]Beat the Street, [90]Facebook or [91]Twitter to find out more, with
   registration opening soon.

After a campaign rally in New Hampshire, Senator Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL)
revealed to a voter what kind of guns he and his wife own.

   Rubio was approached by a man wearing a T-shirt with former president
   Ronald Reagan flipping the bird. The man asked to have his picture
   taken with the senator.

   “Gun question. Glock or 1911?” the man asked as the two posed for the
   cameras.

   “I don’t have either,” Rubio replied. “I have a Taurus .357 and my wife
   got a Smith & Wesson — the Bodyguard .380,” he replied.

   Rubio’s comments were aired on CSPAN as cameras followed him while he
   greeted supporters after his rally in Nashua last night.

   “It’s been a long time up here for you, hasn’t it,” the man said.

   “Wow. It has, but it’s been fun,” Rubio replied.

   The Reagan t-shirt was pointed out on Twitter by someone who was at the
   rally.

   “Look at that t-shirt,” Rubio chuckled after he saw the shirt.

   “Ben Carson loved this t-shirt,” the man replied. “You don’t know how
   many press people have stopped me tonight over this t-shirt.”

   Feb. 9, 2016

   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AAC/SMU) – The SMU swimming and diving program swept
   the final American Athletic Conference weekly awards, accounting for
   almost half of the season’s honors, league officials announced Tuesday.
   SMU is the only program to win all four honors in the same week, doing
   so the opening week of awards as well.
   Male Swimmer of the Week: [193]Bartosz Krzyzaniak
   Male Diver of the Week: [194]Daniel Pitts
   Female Swimmer of the Week: [195]Hannah Rogers
   Female Diver of the Week: [196]Lauren Lamb
   Krzyzaniak posted a career-best and NCAA B cut in the 200-yard
   freestyle to post the top time at the Mustangs’ Pre-Conference Time
   Trial event over the weekend. The sophomore turned in a 1:37.76, giving
   him the second fastest time in the conference so far. Krzyzaniak also
   anchored SMU’s 200-yard medley relay team, posting a 20.29 split to
   help SMU to the top spot. This is his second award (Nov. 24) of the
   season.
   He currently holds the conference’s top times in the 100- and 200-yard
   backstroke, while sitting top three in both the 100- and 200-yard
   freestyles. In relay action, SMU has turned in the fastest time in four
   of five relay events, all of which Krzyzaniak has led off.
   Pitts, who won the first award of the season, picked up his second nod
   after his performance at the pre-conference event. He registered an
   NCAA Zone score of 310.35 in the 1-meter, while also turning in the
   highest total in 3-meter.
   The senior will travel to College Station, Texas, in March to compete
   at the Zone D Championship.
   Rogers’ first award as a Mustang comes after a total of five event
   leading performances between the dual meet with North Texas and the
   pre-conference event. In both events, Rogers won the 50-yard freestyle
   and was part of SMU’s 200-yard medley relay team that finished the
   fastest. She also led off the winning 200-yard freestyle relay at the
   meet against UNT.
   Rogers currently has an NCAA B standard in the 50 free with a
   season-best time of 22.79.
   Lamb posted event leading scores in both the 1- and 3-meter at the
   pre-conference event, while also earning runner-up honors in the
   Mustangs’ dual meet with UNT to help secure the victory.
   The full program returns to action Feb. 17-20 for The American Swimming
   and Diving Championship hosted by Houston at the CRWC Natatorium. The
   women won the title a season ago, while the men finished as the event
   runner-up. For more information on the Championship, visit the AAC’s
   Championship Central [197]page.

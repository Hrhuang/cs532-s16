Emmy Award Winning Broadcaster Fernando Fiore Joins FOX Sports’ Expanding
Soccer Coverage

Assignments Include Copa America Centenario, Mexican National Team and FIFA
World Cup

Debuts on Feb. 10 during Mexico-Senegal Coverage on FS1

   Emmy Award-winning broadcaster Fernando Fiore, who has spent his
   distinguished career working exclusively on Spanish-language
   television, crosses over to English-language joining FOX Sports as a
   co-host and general contributor for the network’s expanding portfolio
   of elite, world-class soccer events. The announcement was made today by
   David Neal, Executive Producer, FIFA World Cup on FOX. Fiore most
   recently contributed to FOX Sports’ coverage of the CONCACAF Cup in
   October.
   Under the new multi-year deal, Fiore serves as co-host and general
   contributor for a multitude of soccer events including the historic
   2016 Copa America Centenario, Mexican National Team home matches, the
   2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Fiore’s new
   role begins Wednesday, Feb. 10, when Mexico, under new coach Juan
   Carlos Osorio, faces Senegal in primetime on FS1 (8:30 PM ET).

   “Fernando Fiore is one of the superstars of Spanish-language
   broadcasting in the U.S., and we are delighted to welcome him to the
   FOX Sports family,” said Neal. “Fernando's vast experience and unique
   perspective will be valuable additions to our coverage of the Road to
   Russia and the 2018 FIFA World Cup."

   "I'm honored to bring my experience and Latin flavor to FOX Sports,”
   said Fernando Fiore. “The wonderful thing about sports is that there is
   no language barrier. Whether the fans watch fútbol or soccer, we’ll be
   presenting coverage of the biggest world-class soccer events. After
   all, the passion for soccer and the sound of GOOOOOLLLL needs no
   translation."

   A leading force in Spanish-language television, Fiore counts with two
   Emmys and countless hours covering the largest soccer events in the
   World. Fiore most recently worked with Univision, handling a wide array
   of assignments including as a studio host and reporter. During his time
   with the network, Fiore covered FIFA World Cups, Olympic Games, Copa
   Libertadores finals, International Championships and multiple
   high-profile championship boxing bouts. He hosted some of the most
   recognized programs in Spanish-language television including REPUBLICA
   DEPORTIVA, Univision’s flagship weekly sports program, TITULARES
   DEPORTIVOS, EN CALIENTE CON LOS MIAMI HEAT and CAMINO AL MUNDIAL.

   Fiore began his broadcasting career as a reporter for Telemundo’s news
   magazine program DIA A DIA before transitioning to Univision to host
   LENTE LOCO, and later FUERA DE SERIE, which he co-hosted alongside
   actress Sofia Vergara.

   In 2006, Fiore authored his first book “The World Cup: The Ultimate
   Guide to the Greatest Sports Spectacle in the World,” providing an
   in-depth look into the history of the FIFA World Cup, its teams and its
   players, which quickly became a huge success.

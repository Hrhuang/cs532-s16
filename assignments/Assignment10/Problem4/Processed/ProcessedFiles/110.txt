   News/Discussion[214]If you are not watching the Premier League, here is
   why you are missing out on the greatest underdog fairytale in the
   history of any professional sport. ([215]self.sports)

   submitted 2 months ago * by [216]hipcatjazzalot[217]x7

   Leicester City, or the Foxes, are a relatively insignificant team. They
   are often fighting for a mid-table place in the Premier League, just as
   often slugging it out in lower leagues.

   An 18th-place finish in the 2003-04 season saw them relegated to the
   Championship (the second division of English football). The next few
   years they would struggle to retain their position in the Championship.
   After a poor 2007-08 season, they sank even lower to League One (which,
   confusingly, is the third division of English football).

   They would climb their way back out of League One at the first attempt.
   The following season, Leicester were widely touted as favourites to win
   promotion back to the Premier League. In 2013 they finally snuck into a
   position high enough to secure a place in the play-offs for a promotion
   spot, but lost in absolutely incredible fashion to Watford.

   It was the semi-final of the play-offs, a two-legged tie. Leicester saw
   out the first match in a 1-0 win. Next they had to go to Watford to see
   out the tie. Watford fought back on their turf, and as the match was
   winding down the score was 2-1, meaning that on aggregate they stood
   tied at 2-2. Extra time, and perhaps a penalty shootout beckoned. Then,
   with just a few seconds left on the clock, Leicester were awarded a
   penalty to book their spot into the final. What happened next... I will
   not even describe. Do yourself a favour and watch:

   [218]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWSc3-NACSY

   Following this heartbreak, Leicester would come back stronger,
   finishing in first place in 2013-14, securing automatic promotion after
   10 years out of the top flight.

   Their first season back started promisingly, with a few initial decent
   results, most notably a stunning 5-3 win over Manchester United. Then
   misery followed, and after months of terrible results Leicester sat
   rock bottom with only 9 matches left to play. It looked certain that
   the door back into the Championship stood open after just one season
   with the big boys.

   Incredibly, Leicester managed to win 7 of their last 9 matches to
   secure probably the most miraculous escape in Premier League history,
   finishing the season safely in 14th place.

   Scandal struck the club during the summer. A sex tape of three Foxes
   players having an orgy in a Bangkok hotel room with some Thai women
   leaked out. The players shouted racist abuse including "slit eye." One
   of the players happened to be the son of Foxes manager Nigel Pearson.
   Pearson and the three players were subsequently let go.

   No one was particularly impressed with Pearson's replacement, Claudio
   Ranieri. He had not managed any Premier League team since Chelsea in
   2004 – back in 2004 he was shown the door by new billionaire investor
   Roman Abramovich, who felt Ranieri wasn’t a sufficiently glamorous
   manager and brought in Jose Mourinho. Ranieri had since had mixed
   success with various Italian teams, and his most recent job was manager
   of Greece – a job that ended in disgrace after just a few months,
   following a humiliating defeat by the Faroe Islands (yes, that place
   with a population of 50 thousand which is not even a country).

   Things did not look good for Leicester. Ranieri was the odds-on
   favourite to be the first to lose his job. Their squad was made up
   mostly of unknown players and a few scraps from the table of bigger
   clubs, including Robert Huth and Danny Simpson, discarded from Chelsea
   and Manchester United, respectively, for not being good enough (Huth,
   in fairness, had since made a name for himself as a rock-solid defender
   at Stoke, but he seemed by now to be past his prime). Their most
   expensive signing of the summer was N’Golo Kante, brought in from
   French team Caen - not exactly a blockbuster signing. With this
   context, it's easy to understand why, going into the 2015-16 season,
   Leicester were favourites for relegation.

   Leicester came flying out in their first match with a 4-2 win over
   Sunderland, and went undefeated their first 6 matches, the only Premier
   League team to do so. After a 2-5 spanking at home by contenders
   Arsenal, their hot streak appeared to be over, and the universe seemed
   to be back in order.

   Undeterred, the Foxes would continue flying. They played extremely
   energetic, rapid, and deadly counter-attacking football. They were well
   organized at the back, with all the players knowing their jobs, doing
   them well, winning the ball and getting it quickly into one of their
   devastating counter-attacks, sprinting across the pitch like a pack of
   wild, well, foxes. And three previously unknown quantities – N’Golo
   Kante, Riyad Mahrez, and Jamie Vardy, started pulling off astonishing
   performances. As they continued winning week after week, the pundits
   picked up on a fascinating statistic: 28-year-old goalscorer Jamie
   Vardy was about to become a record-breaker. But first, more about
   Vardy. If you thought this was an impressive rags-to-riches story up
   until now, you haven’t heard anything yet.

   Jamie Vardy dreamt of being a professional footballer, but at the age
   of 16 he was released from the youth academy of Sheffield Wednesday, a
   team now playing in the Championship. He wasn’t cut out for it.
   Nevertheless Vardy kept playing semi-professionally for minnows
   Stocksbridge Park Steels, a team in the seventh tier of English
   football. He would spend 7 years there, working 12-hour shifts at a
   factory to support himself and playing on the weekends for £30 a match.

   After some impressive displays, he was signed by Halifax Town, a team
   then in the sixth tier. He finished as the league’s top goalscorer and
   helped his team win promotion before signing for Fleetwood Town, now in
   the fifth tier. Again he finished top scorer, and again he helped his
   team win promotion. His impressive performances got him a call from
   Leicester. Finally, in 2012, at the age of 25, when most players would
   expect to have a few years of experience behind them, Vardy could call
   himself a pro.

   Vardy’s first season was poor, but in the 2013-14 season he paid off,
   and his 16 goals helped Leicester to get back into the Premier League.
   Early on in the next season, he turned in a man-of-the-match
   performance against Manchester United, scoring one goal and setting up
   the other four in that 5-3 win. Along with the rest of his team, he
   would fail to make a mark for the rest of the season, but came to life
   at the crucial moment, playing a key role in Leicester’s miraculous
   escape.

   Like Leicester, Vardy got off to a blistering start to the 2015-16
   season, scoring in the first match of the season. Failing to net in the
   next two games, he then scored again in the fourth match. And in the
   fifth. And in the sixth. Twice in the seventh. He scored again in the
   eighth. Twice in the ninth. And in the tenth. By the twelfth match of
   the season, Jamie Vardy, who five years earlier worked in a factory,
   was the top goalscorer of the most competitive league in the world, and
   he had now scored nine games in a row.

   The Premier League record for goals scored in most consecutive matches,
   10, had been set in 2002 by Manchester United legend Ruud van
   Nistelrooy, one of the greatest attacking players since the new
   millennium. Could Vardy match the great van Nistelrooy?

   Could he ever: [219]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUKsTmDjEb0

   Having equaled the record, there was one more challenge left: could he
   BEAT it? Well, what better opposition to go for it than against
   Manchester United themselves?

   [220]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot80PrLmkv0

   By the way, did I mention that Vardy did all of this with a broken
   wrist?

   At the end of 2015, Leicester made history: they were the only team to
   ever go from being bottom of the league on Christmas Day one season to
   top of the league on Christmas Day the next season. Meanwhile, Ranieri
   got his revenge over Abramovich and Mourinho: Leicester City's victory
   over Chelsea on December 14 was the final straw in an incomprehensibly
   dreadful season for defending champions Chelsea. Jose Mourinho, the
   glamorous manager brought in all those years ago to replace the
   unfashionable Ranieri, was fired from his second stint at the club that
   catapulted him to true stardom.

   Thanks for playing, Leicester, everyone said. But it’s time for the
   fairytale to end. Surely these plucky underdogs would start to feel the
   pressure, would fall apart at some point?

   Last weekend was the true test. Leicester faced title favourites
   Manchester City. Manchester City, until very recently, were a club very
   much like Leicester in terms of their accomplishments and titles. In
   2008, the club was purchased by the Abu Dhabi United Group, a private
   equity company owned by Sheik Mansour bin Zayed al Nahyan, a member of
   the Abu Dhabi royal family. Overnight, this once middling team was one
   of the richest in the world. A slew of huge money signings brought a
   wealth of talented players, finally translating into first place
   success in the league in 2012 and 2014. Manchester City are for many a
   symbol of everything that is wrong with the hyper-capitalist world of
   football: forget the youth academy, the club philosophy, the team's
   history and core values. All you need is a lot of money, and the
   success will come.

   Just to put the gap in resources into context between these two teams:
   Leicester’s starting line-up cost a grand total of £22.5 million to put
   together. Last summer, Manchester City brought in Raheem Sterling for a
   reported £49 million.

   That’s right: ONE of Manchester City’s players cost more than TWICE AS
   MUCH money as Leicester’s ENTIRE first team put together.

   Surely, surely, order would be restored?

   Well, Leicester hadn’t read the script.
   [221]http://www.fullmatchesandshows.com/2016/02/06/manchester-city-vs-l
   eicester-city-highlights-full-match/

   It was vintage Leicester: good organisation combined with terrifyingly
   fast counter-attacks. They went to the richest team in the country, and
   they didn’t just beat them. They carved them apart, repeatedly, in
   front of their fans, on their own turf. And they did it in a thrilling,
   entertaining way that was an advertisement to everyone about why this
   sport is so great. Player-of-the-season Riyad Mahrez was at his
   scintillating best, bamboozling the Manchester City defence with a
   brilliant goal. N'Golo Kante was huge in midfield, charging down the
   ball and starting counter-attacks. Robert Huth, the Chelsea reject, was
   a beast at the back and bagged himself two goals.

   Leicester now sit five points clear on first place. They are well over
   the halfway mark. No one is talking any longer about when they will
   fall away. They are odds-on favourites to take the whole thing. If they
   do, it will be an unbelievable accomplishment. This weekend, they
   travel to London to take on contenders Arsenal, one of only two teams
   who have beaten them (the other being Liverpool) early in the season.
   Whatever happens, it will be thrilling.

   EDIT: fixed broken link and a couple other things.

   Haha it still annoys me as a Watford fan that the most famous clip of
   that dramatic penalty miss and goal misses out the part showing a

   I love how, many years from now, Leicester kids will turn to their
   grandads and say: "Tell me again about the time we won the Premier
   League."

   "Well lad it all began with a Thai orgy and a racist manager's son."

   I originally lived in watford, just outside of London. That penalty is
   one of the best moments of my footballing life. However I am now
   studying law in Leicester, the amount of Hype around here is insane,
   you can hear the stadium from almost anywhere in the city centre, so on
   football nights it feels like you are part of the action, even if you
   are not in the stadium. Would love to see Leicester to beat arsenal and
   go on to win.

   Also a notable point with the Premier League...new teams just don't win
   it. Since the beginning of the EPL in 1992-93, four teams (Manchester
   United, Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City) have won every title
   except one, and the one exception was Blackburn Rovers back in 1995.
   And if you go back to 2011 - before Manchester City's new money kicked
   in - the championship had been won by just 3 teams in 18 of 19 years.

   Plus, even looking back to before the founding of the EPL, a club
   hasn't won their first championship in the top division of English
   football since Nottingham Forest in 1978. Every single title winning
   club since then had finished first at least once in their history
   beforehand. Meanwhile, Leicester's best-ever finish is 2nd.

   In 1929.

   yeah there is no balancing system like the draft in soccer. rich teams
   just get the best players every time. I dont even think the EPL has a
   true salary cap, just limits on how much certain types of money can be
   spent on player salaries

   The thing about the "No balancing system" is that the gap between
   typical top flight, 2nd flight, 3rd flight football is bridged with
   promotion and relegation. Sure, in some areas the top teams are vastly
   outspending the rest, but at least you kind of have a hint as to what
   the good teams will be, what the mid table teams will be and what the
   bottom table teams will be. You generally have a clue as to how each
   fixture will turn out, albeit with the odd exception here and there.

   In North American sports, the gap between the Major League and AAA is
   very significant may not fully prepare you well for the major league.
   At least with promotion and relegation, there are teams that have
   recent top flight experience that are playing in the 2nd division. No
   matter what, match a random AAA team against a random major league team
   and you can guess exactly what the result will be. In Footy, there are
   consistently shock results between teams that are not in the same level
   (and this happens consistently in domestic cups where any team can
   enter). The gap is bridged because the teams fighting to avoid
   relegation in one flight are typically on the same level as teams
   fighting for the title and promotion in the league below.

   I wouldn't mind seeing a soft UEFA-wide salary cap that limits the
   ridiculous spending from the likes of Real Madrid, Man United and PSG,
   but you do not want a salary cap that will affect the entire league,
   ESPECIALLY with promotion and relegation involved. Last time I checked,
   teams that come in dead last deserve punishment, not reward. In North
   American sports, they get the first choice in the draft which to me is
   a reward, not a punishment (the team that gets the worst punishment is
   actually the team that barely misses the playoffs). In most football
   leagues world wide, they rightly get relegated and the team that wins
   the lower tier gets rewarded with stronger competition and more
   exposure.

   In each case:
     * the crop of players that got the team in dead last will rightly get
       punished. In the case of relegation they are very unlikely to get
       picked by the teams still in the higher division. Only the
       promising and top players of the relegate teams will get picked and
       they will likely take a smaller role in their new club. In the case
       of North American sports, the players that got the team down into
       last are not only going to get bumped by the top draft prospects
       but also are going to be used as chips when it comes to trading for
       better players.
     * regarding the ownership and management, in the case of the draft it
       doesn't matter as they still have a top flight team, they can still
       make very boneheaded decisions and still be there. Additionally,
       they are rewarded with the most promising talent through the draft.
       Prime example: Toronto Maple Leafs - years of being fucking shit,
       yet no sign of urgency until the sellout has finally disappeared.
       In the case of relegation, they actually have something to fear as
       the owners will no longer get the exposure of playing in that top
       division if they come in dead last and will have to work to get
       themselves back up and in the spotlight.
     * regarding coaches, no matter what they take it the worst by far.
       Get sacked for taking a team to last in the draft situation and get
       sacked for getting a team relegated. In addition, with relegation
       the coaches reputation has been hurt and they will struggle to even
       find work in the top flight (unless the team was VERY bad to the
       point where it was salvageable).
     * Now with younger prospects, they suffer the most from the draft
       because they are forced to play with the worst team for a few years
       and are carrying an immediate burden of being the most important
       man on the team. Without the draft in promotion/relegation
       situations, the prospects are more than welcome to try out for any
       team they wish. The top prospects will actually prove themselves
       and get a spot in the developmental academies of the top teams and
       will start from the bottom in a very low stress role. In addition,
       when they get better, they might get loaned out to a weaker team
       before getting a spot with the top team. No matter how good or bad
       that weaker team did, they are going to return to the top team with
       only their performance on loan in mind and that will determine
       their future at the top club.

   TL;DR - Gaps are bridged by promotion/relegation, Drafts reward shit
   performance and shit management, Prospects get screwed by the draft
   with an immediate burden.

   This is a fantastically written piece. You really capture the essence
   of Leicester City Football Club. I am an Arsenal fan and I sometimes
   find it hard not to admire LCFC, not to cheer them on even though my
   team are in direct contention for the title. It is an amazing
   advertisement for the Premier League and football in general that this
   little known team are mixing it with some of the biggest names on the
   world stage. Worth mentioning that at the start of the season the odds
   of Leicester winning the title were 5000/1 and they were 3/1 to be
   relegated. They are now as low as 15/8 to WIN the Premier League.
   Incredible story.

   EDIT: Spelling

   EDIT 2: Seems the lowest odds for Leicester winning the league are
   actually 7/4 [525]http://imgur.com/tfzHzCq thanks [526]u/Gamerhcp

   it's a great writeup on the leicester points, and then breaks down
   horribly into a regurgitated man city hit piece at the end.

     Manchester City, until very recently, were a club very much like
     Leicester in terms of their accomplishments and titles.

   that's not even close to accurate. manchester city had won the top
   division twice, the fa cup four times, the league cup twice, and the
   european cup winner's cup before the mansour takeover. leicester has
   never won a top division title or an fa cup, let alone anything in
   europe. there was a very hard stretch when city stagnated and dropped
   into the third division, but that's really where similarities end.

     Manchester City are for many a symbol of everything that is wrong
     with the hyper-capitalist world of football: forget the youth
     academy, the club philosophy, the team's history and core values.

   and ignore that mansour made massive initial investments to build a
   brand and expand as quickly as possible into building up his long-term
   solution: a sustainable club with one of the best youth training
   grounds and academies possible. psg and chelsea are a far bigger
   indictment of the system, and anyone who follows football knows that.

   forget the team's history? that must be why city is changing its badge
   (that was made prior to the takeover) to reflect the club's history.
   must be why legendary players, like mike summerbee, are still involved
   in so many club activities.

     All you need is a lot of money, and the success will come.

   fuck right off with that. city has been awful in europe every year upon
   making the knockout stage, and has won the league twice, the fa cup
   once, and the league cup once in eight years since mansour purchased
   the club.

     They went to the richest team in the country, and they didn’t just
     beat them. They carved them apart, repeatedly, in front of their
     fans, on their own turf.

   it was a very big win, but they beat a team that's so injury-riddled
   that its ideal first team hasn't played together since last year.

   also, somewhat ironically, leicester rose from the championship the
   same way that city is being criticized here: bought out by investors
   who threw money at the club (in smaller denominations) until they
   reached the top flight.

   what leicester is doing is incredible, and this write up is very well
   done for the most part, but the dig at manchester city reeks of
   ignorance.

   Leicester supporters en masse seem to respect Man City supporters more
   than we do those of other big clubs. They've at least been through all
   of those lows and stuck through thick and thin.

   And they're actually in Manchester proper.

   As a City supporter, I definitely agree. We were very good years ago.
   However, the play dropped off over time and the quality left the team.
   We were pretty mediocre for a long time. I remember as a young kid
   suffering through the Stuart Pierce era where we were barely staying
   up. Then, the money came in. We bought Robinho and the rest is history.

   Mansour has done SO much for the surrounding community. He's putting
   alot of money into the immediate area around Eastlands (or Etihad) and
   into the academy. We now have one of the most amazing academy
   facilities in the world. Unlike PSG and Chelsea, Mansour wants City to
   become a brand and become the it place to develop your ability and
   become the best in the world (just look at Nacho right now). It's the
   reason we're the first club to have official "feeder" teams all over
   the world for those who don't go to our academy.

   City isn't this big bad wolf everyone perceives them to be. We're good
   for football.

   It's quite clearly biased. Even the Leicester write up ignores things
   that would potentially make Leicester look bad. Vardys video of him
   shouting racial slurs at an Asian man, Leicester were absolutely shit
   on defence - its only the past 6 or 7 games that have shown them defend
   well, Chelsea (title favourites before the start of the season) have
   had an absolute shocker of a season - along with most of the
   traditional top clubs.

   This all shouldnt detract from Leicesters amazing run. But it does show
   the clear bias in terms of discussing leicester.

   I myself want Leicester to win, but let's not kid ourselves. It's not
   the story about the how the good Leicester defeats the evil Manchester
   city. It's just a story about what could be one of the biggest sporting
   upsets of all time.

   Yeah, agree with you about the Man City thing. I'm actually quite
   impressed with how much they have focused on the youth, the club

   This is a great write-up. To further illustrate how crazy this is, it's

   True story

   I went to School with Vardy, He was in the year above me and truth be
   told he wasn't all that good at football. There were many MANY others
   who were faster / stronger / more skilled than he. I played in goal for
   our school team and have saved many shots from vardy over the years.

   Obviously he is better now because he carried on practising after
   school but it goes to show that much of his talent is hard earned and
   not some gift from god.

   Fun thing though, He has gotten our (now retired) P.E. teacher (Eric
   Davis) a season pass to watch from the executive box for all his games.

   He's definitely done his homework each season.

   I'm not sure if he was even the fastest at Halifax Town when he first
   started off here, missing four tap-ins/one-on-ones for every goal
   scored, back when we were in the seventh tier of English football, but
   by the end it was like we were watching a Fifa game after entering a
   few cheats in.

   Back then he couldn't do near what he does now, but the way he plays is
   same old Vards.

   In all fairness, you can take a relatively quick sprinter and turn them

   Chatting shit a bit here really. Playing for sheff weds even if
   released at 16 is in the top few percentiles of football players at
   that age. If he's been picked up by a pro team at youth level and kept
   on til 16 he's got the skills and the potential.

   Where are all the unsung heroes of Leicester's squad?! Vardy / Mahrez
   get all the headlines and now a bit more with Kante. But you need to

   Albrighton, Fuchs, Morgan, Big Kasper, HUTHHHHHH, Okazaki the little

   Not forgetting the vital contributions from the likes of Cambiasso and

   Not sure how I could have missed Danny as well! I thought OP would have
   mentioned him too seeing as he mentioned Simpson coming from the United
   reject bin. Good ol' Drinkwater came from United too, 0 appearances for
   them, what fools they were(are!).

   Another thing people don't realize is that the Premier League has no
   parity like American sports. In American major leagues, there is a
   draft every year where the worst teams get the best new players. There
   are salary caps and other restrictions. None of these exist in the
   Premeir League. The good teams stay good and the bad teams stay bad.
   This makes what Leicester are doing truly a once in a lifetime thing.

   Might have regained one in me. I use to follow the premier league
   pretty good but as an american its exhausting. You really have to go
   out of your way to keep up with whats going on. There are a ton of
   games they are all early in the morning for us so you have to record
   most of the time, then you have to find results of others not on TV,
   then you have to scour to the internet to find people to talk to about
   it, none of your friends in the real world care. Eventually i just
   stopped following because i loved watching but it wasnt worth the
   effort. Ill be watching as many Leicester games as possible.

   Sounds like you stopped a few years ago man, and I definitely
   understand why, but it's so much better now that NBC picked up the
   coverage. If you have cable you can watch any game on their website.
   Plus there are tons of highlight videos, interesting articles, etc. And
   idk if you live anywhere near a major city but there is almost
   certainly a sports bar that opens up early morning for matches. Even
   when they're the "official" bar of a certain team, fans from all
   different teams go to watch the games, mostly bc there are only 1 or 2
   in any given area.

   What an absolutely brilliant write up. I kept saying to myself and to
   anyone who would listen "Nah, their bubble will burst, it alway does"
   but no, they just keep on winning and winning. My dad is 60 next month,
   been following football since he was a kid and even he told me when
   they beat City "I have never, ever seen anything like this, I cannot
   believe what I am seeing". I think all the neutral supporters around
   the Premier League want Leicester to win because then it gives anyone
   hope.

   Well its understandable. You usually get a surprise package every
   season, a team that pushes into the top 4 perhaps (think Southampton a
   couple of seasons ago) and everyone starts talking about them but come
   to around January/February and their form dips and they end up
   finishing somewhere mid-table. This is exactly what I expected, perhaps
   still expect, to happen to Leicester but they keep proving me wrong. I
   agree, I watched them against City and they were sublime, that Kante
   was on another level for me personally. Everyone gives Mahrez and Vardy
   all the credits (which I understand) but for me Kante has been their
   best player.

   Hull City of 2008 is a good example. They won 6 of their first 9 games
   and were a point behind the top spot in November. They won just 2 of
   the remaining 29 games and avoided relegation by 1 point.

   To put this in context for Americans who might be unfamiliar with
   relegation:

   Imagine a baseball that has always been mediocre to terrible. Say the
   Brewers. They were so bad, they got demoted to an Triple-A team. They
   weren't any better there, so they got sent down to Double-A.

   Now they're not just back in the majors, and they've just beat the
   Yankees, they destroyed last year's Royals, and their lead batter is a
   no-name who is on pace to hit 81 home runs. It's July, they have a 10
   game lead, and they're clearly the dominant team in the league despite
   all logic.

   That's not that unbelievable to be honest. Just three years ago the

   be the Kane county cougars winning the world series.

   I'm gonna give you a little extra colour, because the football system
   is fascinating from a NA perspective.

   In England you will have the Premier League, 20 teams, playing a 38
   game season where everyone plays everyone twice, home and away. At the
   end of the season, top team wins, and the bottom three teams are kicked
   OUT of the league into the 2nd tier, called the Championship, to be
   replaced by three teams from the Championship that year (1st, 2nd, and
   the winner of a 4-team playoff).

   The top 4 teams in the Premier League each year also qualify for the
   Champions League, which is a Europe-wide tournament that runs
   throughout the season between all of the top clubs. This is made up of
   a bunch of single knockout matches, a round robin of eight 4-team
   pools, then a final 16-team knockout tournament with random draws each
   round.

   Europa League is a secondary continental tournament, made up of the top
   teams from less competitive countries, the next-best teams from the big
   countries, and the "cup winners" from various countries (more on that
   in a moment). The Europa League also catches the losers from the
   Champions League as they go on, so there's a chance of redemption. The
   winner of the Europa League qualifies for Champions League the next
   year.

   Back to England. While this is going on, there are also domestic cup
   tournaments. These are gigantic, single-elimination tournaments that
   also run throughout the season. The FA Cup is the largest of these,
   with 900+ clubs participating. The tournament starts with teams from
   the 9th and 10th tiers of English football - winners are thrown into a
   pot with the 7th and 8th tier, winners are thrown in with 5th and 6th
   tier, and so on until eventually the Premier League teams are added in,
   and then the real party begins. Small teams from lower leagues have an
   opportunity to knock out some of the largest clubs in the world in
   these tournaments - think March Madness-style chaos. Winner of the FA
   Cup (and other countries' equivalents) qualify for Europa League.

   So if you cheer for a 'big club', or a club like Leicester who had a
   great season, you get to watch:
     * Premier League - 38 guaranteed games
     * Champions League - knockout, 6 game RR, knockout
     * Europa League - if eliminated before final knockout
     * FA Cup - giant knockout tournament, 1-7 games
     * League Cup - smaller (92 team) knockout tournament, 1-7 games

   Oh, and those games follow a nice regular schedule - Champions League
   on Tues/Wed, Europa on Thurs, cup matches on set weekends, and the
   usual Premier League game on Saturday afternoons.

   Nice summary. One small point though, the top [DEL: 4 :DEL] 3 EPL clubs
   don't have to worry about the initial knockout part of the Champions
   League.

   Also, I think you may have left it out for simplicity, but the
   Championship teams that are promoted are the top two and the winner of
   playoff between the 3rd-6th placed teams (3v6 and 4v5 in a home and
   away series, winners to a one game playoff to be promoted).

   EDIT: Fixed number. The 4th team do have to qualify through the
   knockouts.

   actually, the 4th placed team has to worry about the qualifiers for CL,
   since they go to the final stage, there's a 40% chance they lose to
   some team like Bate Borisov (who qualified to CL group stage for like,
   3ish seasons in a row, always starting in the 2nd round)

   it's a possibility but yeah

   Wales has its own league too! It's terrible, but it exists.

   Just to add to the confusion, several Welsh teams play in the English

   Definitely - as a general rule, you'll see Champions League/Premier
   League/Europa League/FA Cup/League Cup as the order of precedence. I'm
   sure others will disagree with that. I personally love cup competitions
   and would rather "hardware at any cost".

   When a team isn't prioritizing a match, they'll sit a few of their
   usual starters, put on some rookies, all of that fun stuff.

   38 game season. You play every team once home and once away. Each match
   is 90 minutes. No extra time. No penalties. 3 points for a win. 1 point
   for a draw. 0 points for a loss. The team with the most points wins the
   league. If there is a tie, it would go down to goal differential.

   and if goal diffirential is a tie then it's goals scored.

   Uncertain what follows that though but i think it's h2h and if even
   that is equal there be a playoff, which has never happened in any
   league i know of. There was a close one though where all the condition
   for it was met with 10 minutes to go in the league. This was in
   Championship battling for the last playoff spot, don't remember year or
   which teams that where involved.

   Edit: Found it, 2008-09 season, Cardiff and Preston, it was more than
   10 minutes though, but still very close

   The season is played over 38 games and whoever has accumulated the most
   points after that period is declared the winner. There are no finals or

   The interesting one here is UK based bookmakers were quoting 5000/1
   (+50000) on them at the start of the season. One has been quite open
   that they are facing a payment in excess of £4,000,000 if they win the
   league (they are now outright favourites). This is how mad this all
   is...

   Edit - didn't spot someone above mentioning a similar point.

   To be fair though, the amount of people who would have bet on Leicester
   would be small. The amount of people who would have bet on Arsenal, Man
   City, Man Utd or Chelsea to win the league would easily cover any money
   they have to pay out for Leicester to win the league.

   yeah, don't believe that. Sure, they might have a total payout of 4
   million on Leicester but bookmakers are in the business of balancing
   the book (that's partly why they're called bookmakers) so that not
   matter who wins, the bookies profit. 4 million in payout, probably 5
   million in wagers.

   (used to be a bookie - they'll say 'oh no we're paying out a fortune if
   that team wins' but they very rarely lose. the only time they'd lose if
   is if they take a huge bet on an outsider towards the end of the event
   and dont have enough time to hedge.)

   top 3 go directly to group stage which gives you millions and millions
   of euros, even if you go 0-0-6.

   a single win in the group stage is around a million euro i think

   the 4th placed team of the Premier League goes to the 4th and final
   stage of the qualifiers for Champions League, and they will be seeded,
   which means they have a high chance to qualify for the group stage
   because the unseeded teams usually come from countries that usually
   have only 1 spot for the Champions League, and they start in the 2nd
   round.

   the loser of the 4th round of CL qualifiers goes to the group stage of
   Europa League, a Champions League for non-champions.

   5th and 6th team of the Premier League go to Europa League

   Thankfully there is no playoff. Meaning that you have a season to play
   for, instead of just having to become in the first 8 spots and having
   only to perform for the last few games.

   Most playoff based leagues have both a regular season trophy and a
   playoffs trophy. For example, the NHL has Presidents' Trophy which
   signify a team as being league champions. A team that wins the playoffs
   is the Stanley Cup champion.

   As a rugby union fan, my first instinct on reading this was to go
   "nuh-uh, Japan claiming their second ever victory at a World Cup by
   beating South Africa was a bigger underdog story!", but the reality is
   that that was one game, whereas Leicester will, assuming they win the
   league, have done so over a series of games against many teams rated
   higher and with better resources than theirs. Fair play.

   Leicester have been amazing and are underdogs to win the league. It
   will be absolutely fantastic if they win the title and I truly hope
   they do. That being said, I know the aim of this is to paint Leicester
   as the ultimate under dogs. However you do appear to have glossed over
   some things when they were in the lower leagues. They were anything but
   under dogs then, and in terms of the championship had been throwing
   money at it for a few seasons. They appointed ex-England and Manchester
   City manager Sven-Göran Eriksson and to quote wikipedia "Eriksson spent
   big in a bid for promotion in the summer of 2011, including
   multimillion-pound transfer fees on Matt Mills and Jermaine Beckford.
   making them pre-season promotion favourites". And on a more minor note
   that penalty against Watford is quite amusing, as it was a blatant dive
   by the Leicester player to win it. Something which is one of the main
   reasons people in North America seem to dislike football.

   Otherwise, great read and excellently written.

   Excellent read. Well written. I'd forgotten about that play off match!

   I'm a Liverpool supporter for the record. I have been wondering lately
   if people are getting the significance of what Leicester are achieving
   here. I really hope they do it. It will be the kick up the arse the PL
   needs. Yes it is a great league and it has become more and more
   competitive over the past three or four seasons. Most noticeably since
   Fergie left Man Utd. If Leicester can do it, it may seem like something
   out of Roy of the Rovers, or something only achievable playing FIFA;
   but, I really believe it will bring balance back to football. It's been
   decades since a team could come up to the top flight and have a chance
   at doing what others have achieved before them; that is, gaining
   promotion and winning the title in consecutive seasons.

   For the good of football I hope they can hold on.

   My concern is what happens when they win the league. We are lucky they
   have gone from bottom to top in one season. If they were like
   Southampton and had a season where they might finish 7th, the likes of
   Mahrez and Vardy would be bought by bigger clubs and the team would
   have never had the chance to see it's potential. We need to savour this
   season because it will be tough to imagine them having all the pieces
   for next season; which is a shame because I'de love to see them against
   a Real Madrid or Bayern with this squad.

   I think if they beat or draw with Arsenal this weekend then they will
   win the league.

   Have to agree, I'm a 'pool fan aswell but the PL really needs this.
   Maybe someone will realize that the extreme talent is too rare and
   fikkle to depend on. Teamwork and hard work is what really wins games
   and if you have that you can win with a team that costs a fraction of
   what the big guys are paying.

   This story kind of reminds me of my home club in germany Darmstadt 98.
   We should've been relegated three seasons ago from the 3rd to 4th
   league and only avoided relegation because our local rival Kickers
   Offenbach didn't get a license for the 3rd league because they lied
   about their solvency. After being last place in the league during
   winter break our new coach nearly managed to avoid relegation but a 1:1
   against the Stuttgarter Kickers in the last match wasn't enough.

   So there we were, avoiding relegation out of pure luck and being the
   number one candidate to get relegated next season. What happened then
   was the biggest fairy tale german soccer has seen in the past decade.
   Our manager started to sign players that failed at their last clubs but
   showed that they were good players years ago. He signed players like
   Dominik Stroh-Engel and others. Everyone was sceptical about this but
   we had no other choice anyway. The club didn't have enough money and
   was the last that could sign players because nobody knew if we would
   play in 3rd or 4th league because Offenbach objected against not
   getting a license. There's a lot I could tell about the season but
   since this comment is going to get buried anyway I will make it short.
   We ended the season on 3rd place with Dominik Stroh-Engel scoring 27
   goals.

   3rd place means playoffs against the 16th place of the 2nd league. Our
   opponent was Arminia Bielefeld. Everybody really thought we just got
   more or less lucky to end the season on 3rd place and that Arminia
   would win anyway. And that's what they did in the first match.
   Darmstadt lost 1-3 at home and nobody except our team thought that we
   could make it to the 2nd tier. The match at Bielefeld was the craziest
   soccer game I have witnessed in my life. We managed to cancel out the
   1-3 by scoring 3 goals and getting one. That meant overtime. We didn't
   get a pretty clear penalty and to make it worse Arminia scored to make
   is 2-3 which meant we would stay in the 3rd tier. Then Elton Da Costa
   jr. entered the pitch. Elton Da Costa jr. jokingly called "The old one"
   by some of the fans hadn't played much in the season and was only used
   as a joker most of the time because of his age. In this game he became
   a legend by scoring the 2-4 in the 122 minute. He quite literally
   bombed the ball into the net from a 20 metre distance. Arminia had one
   last big chance to score that nearly gave me a heart attack but didn't
   and we got promoted because even though the overall score was tied at
   5-5 we scored more away goals. Darmstadt 98 returned to the 2nd
   Bundesliga after 21 years playing in the 3rd and even the 4th division.

   This was it, this was the greatest thing that could happen for years.
   But somehow it wasn't.

   We entered the 14/15 season in the 2nd league as the team with by far
   the lowest budget and again all experts thought that our club would be
   the top candidate to get relegated. We did quite good and never even
   came close to the relegation zone but when asked if he would set higher
   goals for the season now our manager always said something like "We
   need 40 points to not get relegated and that's what we arw focusing
   on". And when the team managed to get the necessary 40 points shortly
   after the winter break still nobody talked about getting promoted. All
   the coach said was "We played a good season, achieved our goal to not
   get relegated and now we will have fun and try to make the big teams
   angry". The last matchday came and we played against St. Pauli who
   where in danger to get relegated so they desperatly needed a win. We
   were on 2nd place with Karlsruhe and Kaiserslautern behind us and
   needed a win too. This time our hero was called Tobias Kempe and scored
   with a free kick. We got relegated to the Bundesliga. After 33 years
   Darmstadt was playing at the best league in germany again. The city was
   celebrating for days and I still sometimes can't believe that we're
   where we are playing against Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund and our
   local roval Eintracht Frankfurt after years of playing against small
   clubs in villages with below 10000 inhabitans.

   This year we have the chance to witness club history. Although
   Darmstadt 98 played in the Bundesliga two times before the club never
   managed to avoid relegation. There's still a lot of games ahead of us
   and nobody knows if we will manage to do it time things could look a
   lot worse. After 20 match days our team already got 24 points and are
   10 points ahead of direct relegation zone. Of course our club has the
   lowest budget in the league this year again and even though we don't
   play fancy ass soccer our players fight until they can't breathe
   anymore and managed to get points against the top clubs like Dortmund,
   Schalke and Leverkusen.

   Sooooo nobody asked for it but still this was me telling you about the
   current fairy tale of german soccer.

   I think there is a sense of historical revisionism when it comes to
   Leicester City. I saw some of the NBC coverage on Saturday and even
   they became slightly deranged by toting out the ridiculous line of 'its
   not about the money' -- as if Leicester were some type of rag-tag bunch
   of part-timers defeating the odds through spending nothing against the
   uber-rich millionaires of the evil empire.

   Granted, the Thai owners have spent relatively little compared to the
   owners at Man City - but let's not make any bones about this. They
   spent a significant amount to gain promotion from the Championship
   (comparable to the rest of the league) and they are continuing to push
   in significant investment.

   Don't get me wrong, I love what Leicester have done this year, but I
   think you need to put this into proper context. With the new TV deal
   next year, a lot of clubs are now paying absurd money for players who
   probably would not have gone to those clubs in previous season. The
   year of the top 4/5/6 dominance is over. Even Stoke went out and bought
   Imbula from Porto - a few years ago that move would never have
   happened.

   I think from next season, more clubs are gonna start to upset the
   apple-cart at the top of the league and Leicester are merely the first
   team to do this.

   Also I take a slight exception at your description of Robert Huth. Yes,
   the guy failed at Chelsea. But that was 10 years ago. He has since
   proven to be a solid top-flight defender at both Middlesbrough and
   Stoke.

   On the one hand Kaiserslautern winning the league after promotion is
   obviously a pretty big deal and you can't call a potential Leicester
   league win unparalleled in the history of any sport. On the other hand
   Lautern are a much bigger club compared to Leicester and were pretty
   successful the years before they got relegated. They came second in
   1994 and fourth in 1995. Then they lost two key players with Sforza
   (Rehhagel wanted him to play for Bayern) and Kuntz, were relegated but
   still won the Cup in that year. They kept most of their team together
   and got Rehhagel to coach them. After promotion they got Sforza back
   (who played one year for Bayern and one year for Inter Milan) and there
   were quite a few players, who where part of the more successfull years
   before relegation, left. Some of the older players even won the league
   in 1991.

   As much as Jamie Vardy's performance this season has been commendable,
   I feel it's important to point out that he has a history of racist
   abuse and was even convicted of assault several years ago. During his
   time at Fleetwood, he needed to be subbed off at half-time because he
   had a police-enforced curfew. He played with an electronic tag around
   his ankle.

   I'm sure this comes off as just me being a bitter contrarian, but in a
   sport where adulation for footballers with histories of abuse, drugs
   and extra-marital affairs is widespread, it's been very off-putting for
   me to see people conveniently ignore this fact in favour of a
   heartwarming story.

   Is it a history of racist abuse if it was once when he was drunk and

   this is awesome. im an american that got into the Premier League 2
   years ago....me and my wife were having a hard time picking a team..on
   a fluke i decided to pick Leicester because i thought the goalies name
   was funny -Schmeichel..i stuck with them and now here they are. My wife
   picked Liverpool because of Skertl sounded like Pokemon Squirtle. GO
   LEICESTER! Edit:im getting called a liar bandwagoner...i picked to root
   for them last year, didnt know their position, didnt think the anything
   more than Schmeichel being a fun name AND for the longest time i
   thought the team was pronounced LEE KESTER, the spelling did not say
   LESTER to me, so that was fun too. i didnt have a team the first year,
   the States try to get us to love Everton for Tim Howard...were only fed
   replays and were not exposed to many teams. No im not a die hard fan,
   im a noob and i simply picked them to root for last year. its fun to
   hear how they were/are true underdogs. I also like Swansea. this was my
   first attack from reddit, sorry for overly defensive :)

   Leicester are having a fantastic season, there's no denying. However
   they have a long way to go before they are near the level of Nottingham
   Forest in the 70s/80s.

   A middling 2nd tier team is taken over by Brian Clough - after an awful
   44 day tenure at Leeds United. They are promoted to the top tier in the
   1976-77 season by the skin of their teeth, finishing third in the
   second division. They went on to win the league and the league cup the
   next season, right after promotion. And the season after that, they won
   the European Cup, arguably the most prestigious trophy in club
   football. They also won the UEFA Super Cup, beating Barcelona over two
   legs. The next year, they won the European Cup AGAIN, beating Hamberg
   1-0 in the final. This was a team that three years previously was a
   second tier English side.

   Theirs was a story so epic they even[1896] made a film about it.
   Leicester are doing well, but even if they win the Premier League and
   THEN win two consecutive Champions Leagues, it still wouldn't be as
   impressive as Forest won the top tier the season after promotion.

   In 50 years time, my grandkids will be asking me how Leicester City, a
   team fighting to even stay in Top Division English Football, won the
   league, and I will reply with "Well, kids, it all started when Nigel
   Pearson's son called a Thai girl a racial slur at an orgy in the summer
   of 2015..."

   But in all seriousness, I'm from Leicester, but I'm not a football
   follower, I'm more of a rugby man. Used to play it n all that, so
   naturally, I could care less about the Foxes, because why would I care
   when we have the Leicester Tigers? THE most successful premiership
   rugby team ever? Made it to 10 consecutive finals and have the record
   of most games won at home.

   But let me tell you, when Jamie Vardy started having his party, I got
   my vodka and my Charlie, grabbed a case of WKD's and got on the hype
   train. Drives my girlfriend (Derby supporter) fucking mental, cos she
   hates that I didn't care about footy at all then when Leicester started
   doing well, I began to take an interest.

   Bloody fantastic right up, and great explanation of the leagues.
   Despite being alive for nearly 2 decades, I never really understood the
   league format because I didn't care enough. I definitely care now, and
   will be pointing all my mates and non-believers to read this, utterly
   sublime piece of writing.

   Bravo sir, bravo.

   These words are enough to show any non-football lover that Football is
   not about 20 guys (the 2 goalkeeper aren't counted) chasing a ball.

   It's a beautiful sport which draws a lot of people, who gather
   altogether in once place, once a week, to stand along their own team,
   supporting them and encouraging them.

   Leicester is a great example. And this piece of text is a very
   well-written proof that football can give strong feelings.

   A properly riveting write up, thank you op! While the story of the team
   of my hometown, AFC Bournemouth, is not as crazy as Leicester's, it is
   still a tense, against the odds kind of one. Basically, in 2009 we were
   in League 2, almost certainly facing relegation to non-league football
   and bankruptcy.

   However, with the help of the likes of Lewis Grabban, Junior Stanislas,
   Joshua King (edit: wording not clear enough, he wasn't with us
   pre-promotipn but is helping us stay in the premier is what I mean),
   Callum Wilson, Yann Kermogant and others we catapulted up to the
   premier league last year with a 1st place in the championship and we're
   going strong to stay up in the 1st Division. I was at home at the game
   that got us our promotion 2nd from the top, and also away at Charlton
   at the game that got us the top place, and the atmosphere and sense of
   achievement was absolutely ecstatic.

   Since being in the prem, we've beaten Manchester United and Chelsea
   (both within a week of each other), both big players in the table. I
   never would've thought I'd see the Cherries of my small seaside town up
   at the top with the big fish.

   The same Bournemouth who failed Financial Fair Play last season?

   I think with your Russian billionaire owner and the antics at the club
   last season, you've made very little friends outside of the Premier
   League.

   Josh King was brought in after you won promotion btw. And he's probably
   on stupid money as well.

   I wouldn't mind Bournemouth if their fans and manager weren't so
   delusional about their promotion last season. It wasn't 'against the
   odds' or even some fairy-tale story. You were the same pre-season odds
   as Watford to get promoted last season and nobody couches them in the
   same terms as they do with you.

   I'm a Notts County fan, a team in the 4th tier of the football league,
   who have been stuck in the bottom two tiers of the professional game
   for years. The monopolisation and big business involvement in football
   has made it increasingly difficult for a team to really rise through
   the ranks. When I was a kid I had dreams of seeing my team rise from
   the 4th Tier to the Premiership, but as I have gotten older and
   football has evolved so exponentially that dream has faded. In the end
   the underdog just never seems to win. If you want to assemble a
   genuinely good football team, you need big money. How can Notts County,
   a team with an average crowd of 4000-6000 ever expect to do that?
   Granted it happens occasionally, a gem of a rookie manager will come
   through or some excellent youth players will come through and aid their
   team until a bigger team comes along, but in the end, most of the lower
   leagues are fairly consistent. The Premiership to me had become a
   farce. How could it ever be fun to support the likes of Sunderland,
   Aston Villa, Stoke City; when the goal for the season is never
   realistically going to be to win the league?

   However, this season has been probably the most refreshing Premiership
   season I have witnessed. The 'Top four' are playing for the most part
   very poor by their standards and teams like Leicester, Watford and even
   Bournemouth, a team I saw my Notts County beat in League One just a few
   years ago, getting results against the bigger teams. I had been ready
   to chuck the towel in with football. County are crap and the owner has
   gone mad, England are rubbish and the Premiership has been boring for
   years, but this season has restored my faith in football. Thank you Mr.
   Ranieri. I'm starting to feel like one day my club could do it.

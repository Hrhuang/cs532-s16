NFL Bans Prospects With Domestic Violence, Sex Assault Convictions From
Scouting Showcase

   NFL logo The NFL informed teams of a policy change in a memo late last
   month that will no longer allow prospects with convictions for domestic
   violence, sexual assault or weapons offenses to attend the NFL Scouting
   Combine – the invitation-only annual showcase event where college
   prospects hope to impress NFL scouts prior to that year’s upcoming NFL
   Draft.

   USA Today obtained a copy of the memo, written by NFL executive VP of
   football operations Troy Vincent, and reported, “Vincent wrote that
   invited prospects would be barred from ‘any league-related event’ if a
   background check turns up a felony or misdemeanor conviction. Players
   that refuse to submit to a background check will also be uninvited.”
   Those players would also not be invited to the Draft.

   The report notes that the changes are only expected to affect a handful
   of the more than 300 prospects invited to the Combine each year.
   Furthermore, any prospects affected by the rule will still have other
   avenues to impress scouts as they are not restricted from attending
   private workouts, pro days or regional combines.

   According to the report, former Michigan linebacker Frank Clark, who
   was selected by the Seattle Seahawks second round of the 2015 Draft,
   would have been impacted by this rule change had it been implemented
   last year. Clark pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of persistent
   disorderly conduct stemming from incident where witnesses said he
   roughed up his girlfriend in a hotel room.

   Under this interpretation of the NFL policy, it appears that the NFL is
   focused more the underlying incident rather than on the ultimate
   criminal disposition of the matter.   In other words, regardless of
   what crime a prospect ultimately pleaded guilty to, he still may be
   barred from NFL events if the underlying incident involved domestic
   violence, sexual assault or a weapons offense.   However, as was the
   case with last year’s first-round pick Jameis Winston, if no charges
   are ultimately brought against a prospect, or they are dropped, they
   will not be banned from NFL events.

   Over the past few years the NFL has faced a lot of backlash as a result
   of its perceived weakness on players with a history of domestic
   violence or other character issues.   According to the memo, this
   policy is another part of the NFL’s ongoing effort to address those
   criticisms.

[34]Amazon Launches Free Game Engine Lumberyard [35]56

   Posted by timothy on Tuesday February 09, 2016 @02:28PM from the
   gratis-not-libre dept.
   [36]Dave Knott writes: Amazon has both [37]announced and released a
   new, free game engine, [38]Lumberyard, which offers deep integration
   with its Amazon Web Services server infrastructure to empower online
   play, and also with Twitch, its video game-focused streaming service.
   Lumberyard is powerful and full-featured enough to develop triple-A
   current-gen console games, with mobile support is coming down the road.
   Its core engine technology is based on Crytek's CryEngine. However,
   Lumberyard represents a branch of that tech, and the company is
   replacing or upgrading many of CryEngine's systems. Monetization for
   Lumberyard will come strictly through the use of Amazon Web Services'
   cloud computing. If you use the engine for your game, you're permitted
   to roll your own server tech, but if you're using a third-party
   provider, it has to be Amazon. Integration of Amazon's Twitch video
   streaming tools at a low level also helps to cement that platform's
   dominance in the game streaming space. Alongside Lumberyard, the
   company has also announced and released [39]GameLift, a new managed
   service for deploying, operating, and scaling server-based online games
   using AWS. GameLift will be available only to developers who use
   Lumberyard, though it's an optional add-on. The game engine is in beta,
   but is freely usable and downloadable today.

       From [87]https://aws.amazon.com/de/lumb... [amazon.com] :
       Q. Is Lumberyard “open source”?
       No. We make the source code available to enable you to fully
       customize your game, but your rights are limited by the Lumberyard
       Service Terms. For example, you may not publicly release the
       Lumberyard engine source code, or use it to release your own game
       engine.
       Limberyard is gratis, and free as in beer, but it isn't free as in
       freedom.

            Unity 3D even has continued support for years and years,
            whereas Mighty No. 9 is all like, "We're having trouble and
            have to mess with the source code and maintain and bugfix UE3
            ourselves because it's no longer updated even though it cost
            $350,000 per seat!" That was fucking irresponsible, and I
            called it from the start: they initially budgeted under a
            million dollars and wanted a (then) half-million-dollar engine
            instead of the $1,500 Unity 3D engine; they're struggling now
            even though they got nearly five million dollars of funding.
            Maybe if you're Blizzard or Bethesda you can use UE4. It makes
            sense, even though it's expensive: Ubisoft dumps like 30 huge
            games every year, so of course they get a lower marginal cost
            (no matter how low you go, when you divide up a licensing cost
            across dozens of units, there's a limit to how much you're
            going to save by taking the less-expensive option). If UE4
            does something Unity 3D doesn't and your game will be
            significantly harder to develop without that feature, deal
            with it; if this happens and you generally develop dozens of
            games each year, then maybe you should buy UE4. Of course this
            applies less now than it did with UE3, since UE3 was
            ridiculously expensive compared to UE4.
            The financials don't make sense. I'd try to fund a
            moderately-complex game on $100,000 with Unity 3D Pro. It can
            be done. I computed $58,000 for art for a 2D top-down ARPG,
            plus another $19,000 for music; I can do the story-writing and
            much of the programming myself, but a competent programmer
            will cost you $26,000 in under a full-time 4 months. I'm also
            a project manager, so I can plan these sorts of things out
            with reasonable effectiveness, instead of dicking around on a
            long tail of things going wrong on top of other things going
            wrong, turning a $100k budget into a $6 million, 9-year
            project; again, a competent project manager will throw you
            $100k a year himself. Your real resource costs for a simple 2D
            or 3D game might be $150k per development-year, plus a
            relatively fixed cost for assets (3D models, textures, music,
            animation). If you're making *one* *game*, the cost of your
            engine is your biggest factor.
            That leaves a big question: What are the marginal costs of
            Lumberyard? Is low cost plus royalty, like UE4? Subscription,
            like Unity 3D? High cost, like UE3? Answer: It's free plus
            monetization, like UE4, but with monetization being tie-in
            service: you can either build an in-house support
            infrastructure for your online experience, or you can use
            Amazon. That means if it comes down to engine cost, you might
            want to go Unity 3D or UE4. The cost of internal
            infrastructure would exceed the cost of almost *any* outsource
            service--Amazon, Azure, Verizon--and being tied to Amazon
            might cost you a lot more than $1,500 for each developer. If
            so, you need to decide: Will the royalties on UE4 cost you
            more than Unity? Between all three, will selecting any given
            one save you enough programmer time to offset the *lifetime*
            cost of any of these factors?

                 of that?
                 5% WHEN YOU SHIP
                 The 5% royalty starts after the first $3,000 of revenue

                 projects, contracting and consulting projects such as

                      now 5% when you ship. Unity 3D lets you go free, but
                      makes you pay $75/mo or $1,500 all at once per seat

   Four Canberra gamers working from a lounge room have seized on virtual
   reality technology to be among Australia's earliest adopters and
   produce a game due for release this year.

   Blackout curtains and more than 10 screens border the Lightning Rock
   office, in one director's lounge room – their focus these past two
   years has been a cowboy hat-wearing marble.

   Within the next six months, the Oculus Rift – recently bought by
   Facebook – and the HTC Vive headsets will be available  to buy in
   Australian stores.

   At prices over $1000, the headsets are still for the tech-obsessed. But
   Lightning Rock hope to capitalise on being among the first in Australia
   producing for the nascent market.

   When their Marble Mountain game is released later this year, it will
   mark a huge milestone for the lifelong gamers.

   "It all probably started about 30 years ago, when [computer] games were
   just coming out," Mr Pickles said. "Because I think that's pretty much
   when the love affair started."

   While they dabbled with development of other games on other platforms,
   it was virtual reality that led programmers Stephen Shorrock and Ben
   Doobov, artist Chris Hahn and producer Shannon Pickles to complete
   their first game.

   "To start with, [virtual reality] is cool, I think that needs to be
   said," Mr Pickles said. "It allows that different layer of gaming
   – it's about having an experience as much as playing a game."

   As a small "indie" company "working out of a loungeroom", they had
   already benefited by lots of attention as early adopters, simply by
   being there when others weren't, Mr Pickles said.

   "We don't have millions of dollars to spend on marketing and
   advertising. But because we're really early into this field we're a
   very small number of people who are doing this at the moment.

   "We can do exciting stuff, new stuff, [and] try and stretch the
   boundaries."

   Their game, Marble Mountain, involves controlling a cowboy hat-wearing
   marble through mazes and the tops of cliffs, from a third-person camera
   view perched above the marble.

   Nod your head down with the headset on, and you'll see cliffs fall away
   to nothing.

   In this sense the game is different from the first-person shooter games
   and simulators that have drawn much of the focus of early virtual
   reality programmers.

   This year, and courtesy of the ACT government, the team headed to PAX
   South, one of the world's biggest gaming conventions.

   Mr Pickles said it was an indication of the industry's potential in
   Canberra.

   "[The government] recognises that [virtual reality] is something really
   exciting, that we could potentially start becoming experts in, and
   doing really exciting stuff with."

MS Dhoni takes a dig at Pune pitch, says it was more English wicket than
Indian

   Pune, Feb 9: A livid India captain [101]Mahendra Singh Dhoni today took
   a dig at the pitch prepared for the first [102]T20 International
   terming it an "English" rather than Indian track.

   Indian batsmen

   Indian batsmen were all at sea against the seam and bounce extracted by
   rookie [107]Sri Lanka pacers to get all-out for 101 in 18.5 overs
   thereby losing the match by five wickets.

   'It was more English wicket than Indian'

   "The wicket was completely different to what we have been playing in
   the last one month (in Australia). It was more like an English wicket.
   There was spongy bounce, and variable pace. The wicket was also not
   rolled properly. Looking at the wicket, we should not have played a few
   big shots that we played," Dhoni said at the post-match presentation
   ceremony.

   Asked if it was difficult to adjust to the Indian conditions after
   playing a month in Australia, Dhoni's sarcastic reply was, "It was more
   English conditions than Indian conditions."

   Dhoni felt that another 25-30 runs could have made the contest
   interesting.

   "This was not a 160 wicket. This was more of a 135-140 kind of wicket
   because there was some help for the fast bowlers. Our shot selection
   should have been better. Looking at the positives, everybody got a
   chance to bat today. The bowlers did really well and another 25 runs
   could have made it interesting. When we went there to field, we
   believed that we can try hard to defend a small total," said the
   skipper.

   Sri Lankan captain [110]Dinesh Chandimal also echoed Dhoni's sentiments
   stating that "toss became important" after he saw fresh grass on the
   22-yard strip.

   "I'm over the moon. I thought toss was important. I saw some fresh
   grass on the pitch. Credit goes to bowlers, they did a really good job.
   It's a young team. Every time we tell them to back themselves and do
   what they are capable of. We are missing a lot of senior players but
   the youngsters have put their hands up and grabbed the opportunity."

   [30]Chelsea are pursuing Santos teenage sensation Gabriel Barbosa, who
   has been dubbed Brazil's "new Neymar," according to reports.

   [31]Sebastian Quinn of the Sun reported that a host of clubs are
   tracking the 19-year-old forward—also known as "Gabigol"—and [32]Tom
   Olver of Metro said the Blues are "weighing up" an offer for the Brazil
   under-23 international.

   Barbosa has scored "over 600 goals at youth level," according to Quinn,
   and made his debut for Peixe at 16. The prodigy netted 21 goals in 56
   appearances across all competitions in 2014 and followed it up by
   claiming 17 strikes in only 47 matches last term.

   The player has been used primarily as a right-sided attacker in recent
   months but has the ability to play as a centre-forward or as a winger
   on either flank.

   Barbosa has a £40 million buyout clause inserted in his current deal
   with the famous Brazilian club and has claimed it is his "dream" to
   walk in the footsteps of Neymar and join Barcelona, via Quinn.

   Here is a video of the teenager's wonderful ability:

   [36]Manchester United and [37]Arsenal are also both reportedly tracking
   the teenager, according to Quinn. The Red Devils have already sent
   scouts to watch the winger, as noted by Squawka's [38]Tyrone
   Webb-McGarthland, who reported that United were expected to lodge a bid
   for Barbosa in the January transfer window, with Santos "open to a
   sale."

   Prospective transfers will depend on who will be Chelsea's manager next
   season, and veteran Serie A coach Giovanni Galeone believes
   [39]Juventus' Massimiliano Allegri has been offered the position by
   owner Roman Abramovich.

   Galeone told Italian station Radio Radio that his former player should
   leave the Old Lady and begin a new adventure in west London
   (h/t [40]Nick Lustig of Sky Sports):

     I think Max will go to Chelsea and will do very well. As one of the
     five best coaches in the world, he will leave Juventus, it makes no
     sense to remain still in Italy.

     For me, he will leave Italy, and I see him going to England because
     the proposal offered by Roman Abramovich is really fantastic.

     Allegri is doing incredible things, even if the club failed to buy
     the players he requested last summer.

   Allegri managed [41]AC Milan from 2010-2014, and then took over
   Juventus, leading them to the Serie A title and Champions League
   final.

   Chelsea will be forced to move quickly to secure a world-class manager
   after the sacking of Jose Mourinho, with very few top coaches currently
   available.

   Pep Guardiola has opted to switch to [42]Manchester City, and Carlo
   Ancelotti will replace the Spaniard at Bayern Munich, leaving the
   marketplace depleted.

   Allegri saw his stock rise last season, as he collected the Serie A
   championship for the second time as a manager, but Juve faltered at the
   start of this season, struggling to live up to expectations after their
   exploits in Europe.

   It is debatable whether Allegri has sufficient quality to take over at
   Stamford Bridge, but the decision will need to be made before the
   summer in order to allow a new coach to make the essential changes at
   the club for the new campaign.

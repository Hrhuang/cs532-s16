   HOUSTON – Mark your calendars Cougars fans.

   The 2016 Houston Cougars football schedule was released Tuesday by the
   American Athletic Conference with the defending AAC Champions already
   selected for four national TV broadcasts.

   UH opens on Saturday, Sept. 3 against 2015 College Football Playoff
   semifinalist Oklahoma in the Advocare Texas Kickoff at NRG Stadium.

   The Cougars will see their first action in TDECU Stadium, where they
   finished 8-0 in 2015, the following weekend as they host Lamar on Sept.
   10 before traveling to Cincinnati for a Thursday-night ESPN
   nationally-televised showdown against the Bearcats on Sept. 15.

   One week later, UH will make a short road trip west to San Marcos for
   its lone non-conference road game against Texas State on Sept. 24
   before returning home for another ESPN national broadcast, this one
   against UConn on Thursday, Sept. 29.

   A rematch of the game that decided the AAC's West Division is on tap
   next for Houston, as it faces Navy in Annapolis, Md., on Saturday, Oct.
   8. The game has already been selected for a national broadcast on CBS
   Sports Network.

   UH remains in the state of Texas for its next five games as an Oct. 15
   home game vs. Tulsa is followed by a short trip up Interstate 45 for a
   Lone Star State showdown vs. SMU on Oct. 22.

   The Cougars return to Houston for three straight home games, beginning
   with UCF on Oct. 29 and Tulane on Nov. 12 before a national ESPN
   audience takes in a Thursday night non-conference showdown between
   Houston and Louisville on Thursday, Nov. 17.

   The Cougars will be on the prowl for a sixth consecutive Black Friday
   win in 2016 as they travel to Memphis on Friday, Nov. 25, to take on
   the Tigers.

   The American's second conference championship game is slated for
   Saturday, Dec. 3, and will pit the winner of the West Division against
   the winner of the East Division at the home site of top division
   winner.

   Kickoff times for the first three weeks of the season are typically
   determined by mid-June. For games past the first three weeks of the
   season, kickoff times will be set by conference TV partners 12 days
   out, or in limited instances, six days out.

   UH will look to become the first team to win outright back-to-back
   titles in The American after claiming the league's inaugural conference
   championship game last season with a 24-13 win over Temple before
   topping No. 9 Florida State, 38-24, in the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl.

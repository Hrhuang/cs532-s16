'We need him to score'

   West Ham 2-1 Liverpool
   Posted at 22:55 9 Feb

   Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: "We had chances but we didn't score
   goals, I saw a good game from my side. We had big fight, a lot of good
   team tactical things, nice enjoyable performances. But the result is
   not what you want.

   Does Christian Benteke need one to go in? "I don't believe in the easy
   goal. He has to carry on like this. It's not the nicest moment in his
   career but he has to work hard. He wants to score and we need him
   to score. We will work on it in the days, weeks and months."

'It will go down in history'

   West Ham 2-1 Liverpool

   West Ham United
   Posted at 22:44 9 Feb

   West Ham manager Slaven Bilic: "I can explain my feelings, and I can't
   at the same time. It is great, for me a really great game of football.
   It was a classic FA Cup tie. It will go into the history of West Ham's
   greatest games. Liverpool, last season at Upton Park, night kick-off,
   goal in the last minute. And we deserved it, I am very proud of the
   guys. They left their heart on the pitch.

   "The goal came as the cherry on the pie of his [Angelo Ogbonna] game.
   He was magnificent as a centre-half. They made the fans proud of them
   and we want to progress even further. If we produce a performance like
   this then we are capable of beating any team in England."

'We were the better team'

   PA

   Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, speaking to BT Sport: "It’s hard. We
   were the better team, created chances and played good football, but we
   didn’t use them.

   "There were lots of decisions that on a better day I’d say were funny
   decisions. I don’t think it was a free-kick [the decision that led to
   the winning goal] but I’d have to see it again.

   "It’s not easy because we were only here to win. You don’t have to show
   your best, you just have to go to the next round. The door was wide
   open for us because we did well but it was not enough. We have to carry
   on and fight to the next game."

   Upton Park ERUPTS! Brilliant noise greets a wonderful header as West
   Ham surely book a place in the last 16!.

   Dimitri Payet's free-kick delivery from wide on the right is superb,
   centre-back Angelo Ogbonna climbs and batters a header across goal and
   in.

   West Ham 1-1 Liverpool

   Kevin Kilbane

   Ex-Everton and Republic of Ireland winger on BBC Radio 5 live
   Posted at 21:47 9 Feb

   "It is such a difficult one to call. Seeing the teams before kick-off
   I thought West Ham, but Liverpool's youngsters have played very well. I
   think a draw was a fair result. It's there for the taking now."

   Will the end-to-end, basketball style game continue in extra time? They
   are often tepid affairs. Will Daniel Sturridge last?

   "You need to try to lift yourself for this last half an hour - it could
   come down to what the managers are saying now. Bilic is down on his
   haunches and Klopp is animated too. It has been an excellent game."

   You can't knock either side for their attacking intent tonight. Great

   Simon Mignolet duffs a clearance out of play and then does the classic
   Peter Schmeichel trick of just berating the nearest defender. Love to
   see that.

   Possibly the only time that Schmeichel and Mignolet have been
   compared...

   Call me a luddite but I love watching Andy Carroll play, he just causes
   havoc. Wins a header at the back post and it drops for James Collins,
   who thuds in a shot right at Simon Mignolet.

   At the other end Daniel Sturridge shoots - over!

   Great replay...

   Any sign in the stats about who is going to nick this in
   stoppage-time? Liverpool edge possession and nudge territory. West Ham
   have cracked more attempts at goal, but more of Liverpool's have hit
   the target. So nope. Tighter than an ill-fitting pair of jeans...

   Mark Noble leans back, thinks of Wembley, and cracks in a shot on the
   bounce from 22 yards which Simon Mignolet has to save. Dimitri Payet is
   playing in the hole now as Victor Moses goes out wide. Can he win this?

   "Big chance. Liverpool gave the ball away to Payet and immediately,
   despite not having much space, he looks for that forward pass. It was a
   brilliant ball to Valencia, but that was poor execution."

   Ah, that's a lovely pass this time from Dimitri Payet, into the

5 Super Bowl Advertisers That Nailed Their Instagram Marketing

   Pokemon led the pack By [29]Lauren Johnson

   Instagram

   Instagram reps today said that 38 million people engaged with the app's
   Super Bowl-related content 155 million times on Sunday. Indeed, the
   visual platform is becoming an increasingly important communications
   channel for consumers—and marketers are meeting them there.

   So how did Big Game advertisers do on the Facebook-owned app? To find
   out, social-media vendor Engagement Labs compared brands' data from the
   week leading up to the game and their traffic on the app last night.

   The Toronto-based company's numbers are comprised of three
   stats—engagement, impact and responsiveness. Engagement stats measure
   likes, comments and clicks. Impact logs how many people saw the content
   either organically or through paid ads. And responsiveness clocks
   marketers' speed, quality and rate of response to followers' comments.

   Based on those three pieces of criteria, brands were given an "eValue"
   score between zero and 100. Each score is benchmarked against
   Engagement Lab's database of 100,000 brands' posts.

   Here's a quick look at how the top five Super Bowl advertisers used
   Instagram, and their respective scores.

   1. Pokemon's eValue score: 84.23
   The brand released its full commercial before the Super Bowl, asking
   fans to spot references to Pokemon in the spot and comment on
   Instagram.

   2. Walt Disney Pictures' The Jungle Book's eValue score: 77.22
   Once the ad aired on TV, the film studio posted a link to the full
   trailer on its Instagram page.

   Walt Disney Pictures also used the platform to post a series of
   trailers leading up to the game.

   spot for The #JungleBook that will air during the Big Game.

   3. Squarespace's eValue score: 74.65
   Squarespace scored particularly high for engagement on posts featuring
   comedy sketch artists Key & Peele.

   For example, the first video that it posted six days ago with Key &
   Peele garnered 1,731 likes and 171 comments. The website domain company
   posted a total of four posts with the comedians.

   4. SoFi's eValue score: 70.6
   Although the financial startup only has 2,570 Instagram followers, its
   fans actively commented on and liked its content.

   According to Engagement Labs, part of the brand's success is attributed
   to the fact that its product—financial loans and services—serves a
   niche market.

   5. Acura's eValue score: 69.37
   While Acura scored relatively low in engagement, the quantity of posts
   trumps other brands.

   The car maker is promoting a Super Bowl sweepstakes on Instagram that
   encourages folks to comment on a Facebook video for the chance to win
   an Acura NSX sports car.

   Over the past two weeks, the brand has posted 11 photos about the NSX
   car.

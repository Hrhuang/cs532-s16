Leicester City Could Become The Most Unlikely Sports League Champion

   [44]Leicester City beat [45]Manchester City 3-1 at the Etihad on
   Sunday. They have a five-point lead at the top of the Premier League,
   over perennial also-rans [46]Arsenal and [47]Tottenham.

   The Foxes play Arsenal next weekend. Spurs and City could take points
   from each other. Leicesterâ€™s lead after next weekend could be
   formidable. Their schedule afterward is everything but. Leicester have
   the added advantage of not playing in Europe.

   This is no longer a cute story. Heading into the seasonâ€™s final third,
   Leicester City are the best team, in the best form, and should be
   favorites to win the title. That is crazy. This team may be the most
   unlikely champion in sports history.

   Last season, the Foxes finished 14th. Their manager [48]was babbling
   about ostriches. Before that, the club was outside the top division for
   10 years. Historically, Leicester has won neither the top division
   title nor the FA Cup. They have not finished higher than fourth in the
   top league since 1929.

   Leicester City did spend about $60 million upgrading its squad before
   the season. But, that was less than, say, Manchester United spent on
   teenager Anthony Martial. Their squad still has [49]the fourth lowest
   market value in the league. Their new manager was 64-year-old Italian
   Claudio Ranieri, who has never won a league title at top level. Many
   [50]had the Foxes pegged for relegation.

   Itâ€™s hard to find a strong parallel in English soccer. Blackburn Rovers
   were the only outside champion in the Premier League era. They won the
   title in 1994-95, in their third year after promotion to the top league
   after a 26-year absence. Though, their owner spent heavily on big-name
   players, notably legendary English striker Alan Shearer. They had
   finished top four the previous two seasons.

   Nottingham Forest won the league in 1977-78, the year after promotion
   from the 2nd division under Brian Clough. They went on to win
   back-to-back European Cups the next two seasons. Forest, though, were
   not as off the radar. They had won an FA Cup in the 1950s, and finished
   2nd in the league in the 1960s. Clough had also won the English League
   in similar circumstances, after bringing up Derby County.

   Itâ€™s harder to find a close American sports parallel. American sports
   leagues have far more parity and distribute financial resources and
   talent more equitably. There are no lower divisions. The best player
   entering the league each year ends up with a bottom feeder.

   Before the 2015-16 season started, Leicester [51]were 2,500-1 shots to
   win the title. They [52]were 1,000-1 to be in first place at Christmas.
   For comparison, the longest futures odds for Super Bowl 51 are [53]the
   Cleveland Browns at 200-1. Preseason odds for [54]the Los Angeles
   Lakers to win the title were 100-1. The notable underdog 1999 St. Louis
   Rams were 200-1 before the season.

   The odds are for somewhat different tasks. Winning an EPL title is
   having the best record. An NFL title can mean going 10-6, getting hot
   as a wild card, and having a few lucky breaks. But, it still shows just
   how unlikely Leicester was to be in this title race.

   Ignoring the mathematical odds, perhaps the 1969 Miracle New York Mets
   might provide one parallel. They won the Pennant with a 100-62 record
   and won the World Series. In their previous seven seasons, they never
   finished above 9th in the NL. Their closest finish was 24 games behind
   the year before.

   Of course, the Mets were in a far more equitable financial position.
   They hired the best GM in baseball, Bing Devine, to build that team
   between 1965 and 1967. They were also in position to shell out the cash
   for Tom Seaver by matching his signing bonus. Leicester City didnâ€™t get
   to have Arsene Wenger work for them for a few years and sign Sergio
   Aguero.

   Leicester City winning the EPL is hardly a fait accompli. If Arsenal
   beat the Foxes at home this weekend, thatâ€™s a six-point swing. Their
   lead would be just two points and they would be under all the pressure.
   Arsenal won the reverse fixture earlier this season. But, weâ€™re in the
   significant portion of the season, and what seemed impossible is still
   possible. With the right results this weekend, it could be probable.
